title: Lower Bounds for Learning in Revealing POMDPs
openreview: 9afHiUivJR
abstract: This paper studies the fundamental limits of reinforcement learning (RL)
  in the challenging <em>partially observable</em> setting. While it is well-established
  that learning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) requires
  exponentially many samples in the worst case, a surge of recent work shows that
  polynomial sample complexities are achievable under the <em>revealing condition</em>â€”A
  natural condition that requires the observables to reveal some information about
  the unobserved latent states. However, the fundamental limits for learning in revealing
  POMDPs are much less understood, with existing lower bounds being rather preliminary
  and having substantial gaps from the current best upper bounds. We establish strong
  PAC and regret lower bounds for learning in revealing POMDPs. Our lower bounds scale
  polynomially in all relevant problem parameters in a multiplicative fashion, and
  achieve significantly smaller gaps against the current best upper bounds, providing
  a solid starting point for future studies. In particular, for <em>multi-step</em>
  revealing POMDPs, we show that (1) the latent state-space dependence is at least
  $\Omega(S^{1.5})$ in the PAC sample complexity, which is notably harder than the
  $\widetilde{\Theta}(S)$ scaling for fully-observable MDPs; (2) Any polynomial sublinear
  regret is at least $\Omega(T^{2/3})$, suggesting its fundamental difference from
  the <em>single-step</em> case where $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret is
  achievable. Technically, our hard instance construction adapts techniques in <em>distribution
  testing</em>, which is new to the RL literature and may be of independent interest.
  We also complement our results with new sharp regret upper bounds for <em>strongly
  B-stable PSRs</em>, which include single-step revealing POMDPs as a special case.
