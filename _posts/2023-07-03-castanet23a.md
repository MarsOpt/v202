title: Stein Variational Goal Generation for adaptive Exploration in Multi-Goal Reinforcement
  Learning
openreview: h2AnGFDclp
abstract: In multi-goal Reinforcement Learning, an agent can share experience between
  related training tasks, resulting in better generalization for new tasks at test
  time. However, when the goal space has discontinuities and the reward is sparse,
  a majority of goals are difficult to reach. In this context, a curriculum over goals
  helps agents learn by adapting training tasks to their current capabilities. In
  this work, we propose Stein Variational Goal Generation (SVGG), which samples goals
  of intermediate difficulty for the agent, by leveraging a learned predictive model
  of its goal reaching capabilities. The distribution of goals is modeled with particles
  that are attracted in areas of appropriate difficulty using Stein Variational Gradient
  Descent. We show that SVGG outperforms state-of-the-art multi-goal Reinforcement
  Learning methods in terms of success coverage in hard exploration problems, and
  demonstrate that it is endowed with a useful recovery property when the environment
  changes.
