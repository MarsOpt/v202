title: Chemically Transferable Generative Backmapping of Coarse-Grained Proteins
openreview: 7DnvWyVkUo
abstract: 'Coarse-graining (CG) accelerates molecular simulations of protein dynamics
  by simulating sets of atoms as singular beads. Backmapping is the opposite operation
  of bringing lost atomistic details back from the CG representation. While machine
  learning (ML) has produced accurate and efficient CG simulations of proteins, fast
  and reliable backmapping remains a challenge. Rule-based methods produce poor all-atom
  geometries, needing computationally costly refinement through additional simulations.
  Recently proposed ML approaches outperform traditional baselines but are not transferable
  between proteins and sometimes generate unphysical atom placements with steric clashes
  and implausible torsion angles. This work addresses both issues to build a fast,
  transferable, and reliable generative backmapping tool for CG protein representations.
  We achieve generalization and reliability through a combined set of innovations:
  representation based on internal coordinates; an equivariant encoder/prior; a custom
  loss function that helps ensure local structure, global structure, and physical
  constraints; and expert curation of high-quality out-of-equilibrium protein data
  for training. Our results pave the way for out-of-the-box backmapping of coarse-grained
  simulations for arbitrary proteins.'
