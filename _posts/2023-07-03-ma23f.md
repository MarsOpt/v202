title: 'Over-parametrization via Lifting for Low-rank Matrix Sensing: Conversion of
  Spurious Solutions to Strict Saddle Points'
openreview: X2JJxvcAfT
abstract: This paper studies the role of over-parametrization in solving non-convex
  optimization problems. The focus is on the important class of low-rank matrix sensing,
  where we propose an infinite hierarchy of non-convex problems via the lifting technique
  and the Burer-Monteiro factorization. This contrasts with the existing over-parametrization
  technique where the search rank is limited by the dimension of the matrix and it
  does not allow a rich over-parametrization of an arbitrary degree. We show that
  although the spurious solutions of the problem remain stationary points through
  the hierarchy, they will be transformed into strict saddle points (under some technical
  conditions) and can be escaped via local search methods. This is the first result
  in the literature showing that over-parametrization creates a negative curvature
  for escaping spurious solutions. We also derive a bound on how much over-parametrization
  is requited to enable the elimination of spurious solutions.
