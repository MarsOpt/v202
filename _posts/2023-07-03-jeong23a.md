title: Recovering Top-Two Answers and Confusion Probability in Multi-Choice Crowdsourcing
openreview: EM1HUyzWV0
abstract: Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective platform for labeling large amounts
  of data in a cost- and time-efficient manner. Most previous work has focused on
  designing an efficient algorithm to recover only the ground-truth labels of the
  data. In this paper, we consider multi-choice crowdsourcing tasks with the goal
  of recovering not only the ground truth, but also the most confusing answer and
  the confusion probability. The most confusing answer provides useful information
  about the task by revealing the most plausible answer other than the ground truth
  and how plausible it is. To theoretically analyze such scenarios, we propose a model
  in which there are the top two plausible answers for each task, distinguished from
  the rest of the choices. Task difficulty is quantified by the probability of confusion
  between the top two, and worker reliability is quantified by the probability of
  giving an answer among the top two. Under this model, we propose a two-stage inference
  algorithm to infer both the top two answers and the confusion probability. We show
  that our algorithm achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate. We conduct both
  synthetic and real data experiments and demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms
  other recent algorithms. We also show the applicability of our algorithms in inferring
  the difficulty of tasks and in training neural networks with top-two soft labels.
