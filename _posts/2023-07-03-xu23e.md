title: Probabilistic Categorical Adversarial Attack and Adversarial Training
openreview: 79b2zU6fGb
abstract: The studies on adversarial attacks and defenses have greatly improved the
  robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Most advanced approaches have been overwhelmingly
  designed for continuous data such as images. However, these achievements are still
  hard to be generalized to categorical data. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
  framework, Probabilistic Categorical Adversarial Attack (or PCAA). It transfers
  the discrete optimization problem of finding categorical adversarial examples to
  a continuous problem that can be solved via gradient-based methods. We analyze the
  optimality (attack success rate) and time complexity of PCAA to demonstrate its
  significant advantage over current search-based attacks. More importantly, through
  extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate that the well-established defenses for
  continuous data, such as adversarial training and TRADES, can be easily accommodated
  to defend DNNs for categorical data.
