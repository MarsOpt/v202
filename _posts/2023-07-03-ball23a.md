title: Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Data
openreview: h11j9w1ucU
abstract: 'Sample efficiency and exploration remain major challenges in online reinforcement
  learning (RL). A powerful approach that can be applied to address these issues is
  the inclusion of offline data, such as prior trajectories from a human expert or
  a sub-optimal exploration policy. Previous methods have relied on extensive modifications
  and additional complexity to ensure the effective use of this data. Instead, we
  ask: <em>can we simply apply existing off-policy methods to leverage offline data
  when learning online?</em> In this work, we demonstrate that the answer is yes;
  however, a set of minimal but important changes to existing off-policy RL algorithms
  are required to achieve reliable performance. We extensively ablate these design
  choices, demonstrating the key factors that most affect performance, and arrive
  at a set of recommendations that practitioners can readily apply, whether their
  data comprise a small number of expert demonstrations or large volumes of sub-optimal
  trajectories. We see that correct application of these simple recommendations can
  provide a $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ improvement over existing approaches across a diverse
  set of competitive benchmarks, with no additional computational overhead.'
