title: Improved Algorithms for Multi-period Multi-class Packing Problems with Bandit
  Feedback
openreview: TlCi3HwLMj
abstract: We consider the linear contextual multi-class multi-period packing problem
  (LMMP) where the goal is to pack items such that the total vector of consumption
  is below a given budget vector and the total value is as large as possible. We consider
  the setting where the reward and the consumption vector associated with each action
  is a class-dependent linear function of the context, and the decision-maker receives
  bandit feedback. LMMP includes linear contextual bandits with knapsacks and online
  revenue management as special cases. We establish a new estimator which guarantees
  a faster convergence rate, and consequently, a lower regret in LMMP. We propose
  a bandit policy that is a closed-form function of said estimated parameters. When
  the contexts are non-degenerate, the regret of the proposed policy is sublinear
  in the context dimension, the number of classes, and the time horizon $T$ when the
  budget grows at least as $\sqrt{T}$. We also resolve an open problem posed in Agrawal
  & Devanur (2016) and extend the result to a multi-class setting. Our numerical experiments
  clearly demonstrate that the performance of our policy is superior to other benchmarks
  in the literature.
