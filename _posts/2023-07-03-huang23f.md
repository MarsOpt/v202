title: Fast Algorithms for Distributed k-Clustering with Outliers
openreview: idu4rmRhu0
abstract: In this paper, we study the $k$-clustering problems with outliers in distributed
  setting. The current best results for the distributed $k$-center problem with outliers
  have quadratic local running time with communication cost dependent on the aspect
  ratio $\Delta$ of the given instance, which may constraint the scalability of the
  algorithms for handling large-scale datasets. To achieve better communication cost
  for the problem with faster local running time, we propose an inliers-recalling
  sampling method, which avoids guessing the optimal radius of the given instance,
  and can achieve a 4-round bi-criteria $(14(1+\epsilon),1+\epsilon)$-approximation
  with linear local running time in the data size and communication cost independent
  of the aspect ratio. To obtain a more practical algorithm for the problem, we propose
  another space-narrowing sampling method, which automatically adjusts the sample
  size to adapt to different outliers distributions on each machine, and can achieve
  a 2-round bi-criteria $(14(1+\epsilon),1+\epsilon)$-approximation with communication
  cost independent of the number of outliers. We show that, if the data points are
  randomly partitioned across machines, our proposed sampling-based methods can be
  extended to the $k$-median/means problems with outliers, and can achieve $(O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}),1+\epsilon)$-approximation
  with communication cost independent of the number of outliers. Empirical experiments
  suggest that the proposed 2-round distributed algorithms outperform other state-of-the-art
  algorithms.
