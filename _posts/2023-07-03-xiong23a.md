title: Universal Morphology Control via Contextual Modulation
openreview: PzlO3SSk3A
abstract: 'Learning a universal policy across different robot morphologies can significantly
  improve learning efficiency and generalization in continuous control. However, it
  poses a challenging multi-task reinforcement learning problem, as the optimal policy
  may be quite different across robots and critically depend on the morphology. Existing
  methods utilize graph neural networks or transformers to handle heterogeneous state
  and action spaces across different morphologies, but pay little attention to the
  dependency of a robotâ€™s control policy on its morphology context. In this paper,
  we propose a hierarchical architecture to better model this dependency via contextual
  modulation, which includes two key submodules: (1) Instead of enforcing hard parameter
  sharing across robots, we use hypernetworks to generate morphology-dependent control
  parameters; (2) We propose a fixed attention mechanism that solely depends on the
  morphology to modulate the interactions between different limbs in a robot. Experimental
  results show that our method not only improves learning performance on a diverse
  set of training robots, but also generalizes better to unseen morphologies in a
  zero-shot fashion. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MasterXiong/ModuMorph.'
