title: Probabilistic Imputation for Time-series Classification with Missing Data
openreview: 7pcZLgulIV
abstract: Multivariate time series data for real-world applications typically contain
  a significant amount of missing values. The dominant approach for classification
  with such missing values is to impute them heuristically with specific values (zero,
  mean, values of adjacent time-steps) or learnable parameters. However, these simple
  strategies do not take the data generative process into account, and more importantly,
  do not effectively capture the uncertainty in prediction due to the multiple possibilities
  for the missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
  for classification with multivariate time series data with missing values. Our model
  consists of two parts; a deep generative model for missing value imputation and
  a classifier. Extending the existing deep generative models to better capture structures
  of time-series data, our deep generative model part is trained to impute the missing
  values in multiple plausible ways, effectively modeling the uncertainty of the imputation.
  The classifier part takes the time series data along with the imputed missing values
  and classifies signals, and is trained to capture the predictive uncertainty due
  to the multiple possibilities of imputations. Importantly, we show that na√Øvely
  combining the generative model and the classifier could result in trivial solutions
  where the generative model does not produce meaningful imputations. To resolve this,
  we present a novel regularization technique that can promote the model to produce
  useful imputation values that help classification. Through extensive experiments
  on real-world time series data with missing values, we demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our method.
