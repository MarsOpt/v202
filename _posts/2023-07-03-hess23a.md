title: Generalized Teacher Forcing for Learning Chaotic Dynamics
openreview: eyTrDtchE1
abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems (DS) are ubiquitous in nature and society. Often
  we are interested in reconstructing such systems from observed time series for prediction
  or mechanistic insight, where by reconstruction we mean learning geometrical and
  invariant temporal properties of the system in question (like attractors). However,
  training reconstruction algorithms like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on such
  systems by gradient-descent based techniques faces severe challenges. This is mainly
  due to exploding gradients caused by the exponential divergence of trajectories
  in chaotic systems. Moreover, for (scientific) interpretability we wish to have
  as low dimensional reconstructions as possible, preferably in a model which is mathematically
  tractable. Here we report that a surprisingly simple modification of teacher forcing
  leads to provably strictly all-time bounded gradients in training on chaotic systems,
  and, when paired with a simple architectural rearrangement of a tractable RNN design,
  piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs), allows for faithful reconstruction in spaces of
  at most the dimensionality of the observed system. We show on several DS that with
  these amendments we can reconstruct DS better than current SOTA algorithms, in much
  lower dimensions. Performance differences were particularly compelling on real world
  data with which most other methods severely struggled. This work thus led to a simple
  yet powerful DS reconstruction algorithm which is highly interpretable at the same
  time.
