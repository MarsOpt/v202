title: On the Generalization of Multi-modal Contrastive Learning
openreview: lGpttiCpFZ
abstract: Multi-modal contrastive learning (MMCL) has recently garnered considerable
  interest due to its superior performance in visual tasks, achieved by embedding
  multi-modal data, such as visual-language pairs. However, there still lack theoretical
  understandings of how MMCL extracts useful visual representation from multi-modal
  pairs, and particularly, how MMCL outperforms previous approaches like self-supervised
  contrastive learning (SSCL). In this paper, by drawing an intrinsic connection between
  MMCL and asymmetric matrix factorization, we establish the first generalization
  guarantees of MMCL for visual downstream tasks. Based on this framework, we further
  unify MMCL and SSCL by showing that MMCL implicitly performs SSCL with (pseudo)
  positive pairs induced by text pairs. Through this unified perspective, we characterize
  the advantage of MMCL by showing that text pairs induce more semantically consistent
  and diverse positive pairs, which, according to our analysis, provably benefit downstream
  generalization. Inspired by this finding, we propose several methods to significantly
  improve the downstream performance of SSCL on ImageNet by leveraging multi-modal
  information. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/CLIP-Help-SimCLR.
