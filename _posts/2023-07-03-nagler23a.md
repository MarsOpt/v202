title: Statistical Foundations of Prior-Data Fitted Networks
openreview: HFBBLgPL8x
abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) were recently proposed as a new paradigm
  for machine learning. Instead of training the network to an observed training set,
  a fixed model is pre-trained offline on small, simulated training sets from a variety
  of tasks. The pre-trained model is then used to infer class probabilities in-context
  on fresh training sets with arbitrary size and distribution. Empirically, PFNs achieve
  state-of-the-art performance on tasks with similar size to the ones used in pre-training.
  Surprisingly, their accuracy further improves when passed larger data sets during
  inference. This article establishes a theoretical foundation for PFNs and illuminates
  the statistical mechanisms governing their behavior. While PFNs are motivated by
  Bayesian ideas, a purely frequentistic interpretation of PFNs as pre-tuned, but
  untrained predictors explains their behavior. A predictorâ€™s variance vanishes if
  its sensitivity to individual training samples does and the bias vanishes only if
  it is appropriately localized around the test feature. The transformer architecture
  used in current PFN implementations ensures only the former. These findings shall
  prove useful for designing architectures with favorable empirical behavior.
