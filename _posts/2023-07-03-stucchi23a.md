title: Kernel QuantTree
openreview: KVFQ5fUmHg
abstract: 'We present Kernel QuantTree (KQT), a non-parametric change detection algorithm
  that monitors multivariate data through a histogram. KQT constructs a nonlinear
  partition of the input space that matches pre-defined target probabilities and specifically
  promotes compact bins adhering to the data distribution, resulting in a powerful
  detection algorithm. We prove two key theoretical advantages of KQT: <em>i</em>)
  statistics defined over the KQT histogram do not depend on the stationary data distribution
  $\phi_0$, so detection thresholds can be set a priori to control false positive
  rate, and <em>ii</em>) thanks to the kernel functions adopted, the KQT monitoring
  scheme is invariant to the roto-translation of the input data. Consequently, KQT
  does not require any preprocessing step like PCA. Our experiments show that KQT
  achieves superior detection power than non-parametric state-of-the-art change detection
  methods, and can reliably control the false positive rate.'
