title: Robust Budget Pacing with a Single Sample
openreview: 5h42xM0pwn
abstract: 'Major Internet advertising platforms offer budget pacing tools as a standard
  service for advertisers to manage their ad campaigns. Given the inherent non-stationarity
  in an advertiser’s value and also competing advertisers’ values over time, a commonly
  used approach is to learn a target expenditure plan that specifies a target spend
  as a function of time, and then run a controller that tracks this plan. This raises
  the question: <em>how many historical samples are required to learn a good expenditure
  plan</em>? We study this question by considering an advertiser repeatedly participating
  in $T$ second-price auctions, where the tuple of her value and the highest competing
  bid is drawn from an unknown time-varying distribution. The advertiser seeks to
  maximize her total utility subject to her budget constraint. Prior work has shown
  the sufficiency of <em>$T\log T$ samples per distribution</em> to achieve the optimal
  $O(\sqrt{T})$-regret. We dramatically improve this state-of-the-art and show that
  <em>just one sample per distribution</em> is enough to achieve the near-optimal
  $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$-regret, while still being robust to noise in the sampling distributions.'
