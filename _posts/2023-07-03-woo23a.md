title: 'The Blessing of Heterogeneity in Federated Q-Learning: Linear Speedup and
  Beyond'
openreview: WfI3I8OjHS
abstract: In this paper, we consider federated Q-learning, which aims to learn an
  optimal Q-function by periodically aggregating local Q-estimates trained on local
  data alone. Focusing on infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes, we provide
  sample complexity guarantees for both the synchronous and asynchronous variants
  of federated Q-learning. In both cases, our bounds exhibit a linear speedup with
  respect to the number of agents and sharper dependencies on other salient problem
  parameters. Moreover, existing approaches to federated Q-learning adopt an equally-weighted
  averaging of local Q-estimates, which can be highly sub-optimal in the asynchronous
  setting since the local trajectories can be highly heterogeneous due to different
  local behavior policies. Existing sample complexity scales inverse proportionally
  to the minimum entry of the stationary state-action occupancy distributions over
  all agents, requiring that every agent covers the entire state-action space. Instead,
  we propose a novel importance averaging algorithm, giving larger weights to more
  frequently visited state-action pairs. The improved sample complexity scales inverse
  proportionally to the minimum entry of the average stationary state-action occupancy
  distribution of all agents, thus only requiring the agents collectively cover the
  entire state-action space, unveiling the blessing of heterogeneity.
