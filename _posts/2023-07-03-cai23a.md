title: Causal Discovery with Latent Confounders Based on Higher-Order Cumulants
openreview: O1Hn6YF5IF
abstract: Causal discovery with latent confounders is an important but challenging
  task in many scientific areas. Despite the success of some overcomplete independent
  component analysis (OICA) based methods in certain domains, they are computationally
  expensive and can easily get stuck into local optima. We notice that interestingly,
  by making use of higher-order cumulants, there exists a closed-form solution to
  OICA in specific cases, e.g., when the mixing procedure follows the One-Latent-Component
  structure. In light of the power of the closed-form solution to OICA corresponding
  to the One-Latent-Component structure, we formulate a way to estimate the mixing
  matrix using the higher-order cumulants, and further propose the testable One-Latent-Component
  condition to identify the latent variables and determine causal orders. By iteratively
  removing the share identified latent components, we successfully extend the results
  on the One-Latent-Component structure to the Multi-Latent-Component structure and
  finally provide a practical and asymptotically correct algorithm to learn the causal
  structure with latent variables. Experimental results illustrate the asymptotic
  correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method.
