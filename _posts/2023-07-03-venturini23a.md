title: Learning the Right Layers a Data-Driven Layer-Aggregation Strategy for Semi-Supervised
  Learning on Multilayer Graphs
openreview: X8h8wLjog7
abstract: Clustering (or community detection) on multilayer graphs poses several additional
  complications with respect to standard graphs as different layers may be characterized
  by different structures and types of information. One of the major challenges is
  to establish the extent to which each layer contributes to the cluster assignment
  in order to effectively take advantage of the multilayer structure and improve upon
  the classification obtained using the individual layers or their union. However,
  making an informed a-priori assessment about the clustering information content
  of the layers can be very complicated. In this work, we assume a semi-supervised
  learning setting, where the class of a small percentage of nodes is initially provided,
  and we propose a parameter-free Laplacian-regularized model that learns an optimal
  nonlinear combination of the different layers from the available input labels. The
  learning algorithm is based on a Frank-Wolfe optimization scheme with inexact gradient,
  combined with a modified Label Propagation iteration. We provide a detailed convergence
  analysis of the algorithm and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
  datasets, showing that the proposed method compares favourably with a variety of
  baselines and outperforms each individual layer when used in isolation.
