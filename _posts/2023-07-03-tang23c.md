title: 'From Perception to Programs: Regularize, Overparameterize, and Amortize'
openreview: H6bzZQ8NM7
abstract: We develop techniques for synthesizing neurosymbolic programs. Such programs
  mix discrete symbolic processing with continuous neural computation. We relax this
  mixed discrete/continuous problem and jointly learn all modules with gradient descent,
  and also incorporate amortized inference, overparameterization, and a differentiable
  strategy for penalizing lengthy programs. Collectedly this toolbox improves the
  stability of gradient-guided program search, and suggests ways of learning both
  how to parse continuous input into discrete abstractions, and how to process those
  abstractions via symbolic code.
