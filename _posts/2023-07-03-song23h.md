title: 'Sketching for First Order Method: Efficient Algorithm for Low-Bandwidth Channel
  and Vulnerability'
openreview: uIzkbJgyqc
abstract: Sketching is one of the most fundamental tools in large-scale machine learning.
  It enables runtime and memory saving via randomly compressing the original large
  problem into lower dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel sketching scheme
  for the first order method in large-scale distributed learning setting, such that
  the communication costs between distributed agents are saved while the convergence
  of the algorithms is still guaranteed. Given gradient information in a high dimension
  $d$, the agent passes the compressed information processed by a sketching matrix
  $R\in \mathbb{R}^{s\times d}$ with $s\ll d$, and the receiver de-compressed via
  the de-sketching matrix $R^\top$ to “recover” the information in original dimension.
  Using such a framework, we develop algorithms for federated learning with lower
  communication costs. However, such random sketching does not protect the privacy
  of local data directly. We show that the gradient leakage problem still exists after
  applying the sketching technique by presenting a specific gradient attack method.
  As a remedy, we prove rigorously that the algorithm will be differentially private
  by adding additional random noises in gradient information, which results in a both
  communication-efficient and differentially private first order approach for federated
  learning tasks. Our sketching scheme can be further generalized to other learning
  settings and might be of independent interest itself.
