title: Progressive Purification for Instance-Dependent Partial Label Learning
openreview: inClAaZKvc
abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) aims to train multiclass classifiers from the
  examples each annotated with a set of candidate labels where a fixed but unknown
  candidate label is correct. In the last few years, the instance-independent generation
  process of candidate labels has been extensively studied, on the basis of which
  many theoretical advances have been made in PLL. Nevertheless, the candidate labels
  are always instance-dependent in practice and there is no theoretical guarantee
  that the model trained on the instance-dependent PLL examples can converge to an
  ideal one. In this paper, a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach
  named POP, i.e. PrOgressive Purification for instance-dependent partial label learning,
  is proposed. Specifically, POP updates the learning model and purifies each candidate
  label set progressively in every epoch. Theoretically, we prove that POP enlarges
  the region appropriately fast where the model is reliable, and eventually approximates
  the Bayes optimal classifier with mild assumptions. Technically, POP is flexible
  with arbitrary PLL losses and could improve the performance of the previous PLL
  losses in the instance-dependent case. Experiments on the benchmark datasets and
  the real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
