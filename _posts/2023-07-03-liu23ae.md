title: Algorithms for bounding contribution for histogram estimation under user-level
  privacy
openreview: 2WEMW6rGgG
abstract: We study the problem of histogram estimation under user-level differential
  privacy, where the goal is to preserve the privacy of <em>all</em> entries of any
  single user. We consider the heterogeneous scenario where the quantity of data can
  be different for each user. In this scenario, the amount of noise injected into
  the histogram to obtain differential privacy is proportional to the maximum user
  contribution, which can be amplified by few outliers. One approach to circumvent
  this would be to bound (or limit) the contribution of each user to the histogram.
  However, if users are limited to small contributions, a significant amount of data
  will be discarded. In this work, we propose algorithms to choose the best user contribution
  bound for histogram estimation under both bounded and unbounded domain settings.
  When the size of the domain is bounded, we propose a user contribution bounding
  strategy that almost achieves a two-approximation with respect to the best contribution
  bound in hindsight. For unbounded domain histogram estimation, we propose an algorithm
  that is logarithmic-approximation with respect to the best contribution bound in
  hindsight. This result holds without any distribution assumptions on the data. Experiments
  on both real and synthetic datasets verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our algorithms. We also show that clipping bias introduced
  by bounding user contribution may be reduced under mild distribution assumptions,
  which can be of independent interest.
