title: 'Tighter Lower Bounds for Shuffling SGD: Random Permutations and Beyond'
openreview: 3bkRh3ggAE
abstract: We study convergence lower bounds of without-replacement stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD) for solving smooth (strongly-)convex finite-sum minimization problems.
  Unlike most existing results focusing on final iterate lower bounds in terms of
  the number of components $n$ and the number of epochs $K$, we seek bounds for arbitrary
  weighted average iterates that are tight in all factors including the condition
  number $\kappa$. For SGD with Random Reshuffling, we present lower bounds that have
  tighter $\kappa$ dependencies than existing bounds. Our results are the first to
  perfectly close the gap between lower and upper bounds for weighted average iterates
  in both strongly-convex and convex cases. We also prove weighted average iterate
  lower bounds for arbitrary permutation-based SGD, which apply to all variants that
  carefully choose the best permutation. Our bounds improve the existing bounds in
  factors of $n$ and $\kappa$ and thereby match the upper bounds shown for a recently
  proposed algorithm called GraB.
