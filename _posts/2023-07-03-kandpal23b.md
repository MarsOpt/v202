title: 'Git-Theta: A Git Extension for Collaborative Development of Machine Learning
  Models'
openreview: d3SabwKYga
abstract: Currently, most machine learning models are trained by centralized teams
  and are rarely updated. In contrast, open-source software development involves the
  iterative development of a shared artifact through distributed collaboration using
  a version control system. In the interest of enabling collaborative and continual
  improvement of machine learning models (Raffel, 2023), we introduce Git-Theta, a
  version control system for machine learning models. Git-Theta is an extension to
  Git, the most widely used version control software, that allows fine-grained tracking
  of changes to model parameters alongside code and other artifacts. Unlike existing
  version control systems that treat a model checkpoint as a blob of data, Git-Theta
  leverages the structure of checkpoints to support communication-efficient updates,
  automatic model merges, and meaningful reporting about the difference between two
  versions of a model. In addition, Git-Theta includes a plug-in system that enables
  users to easily add support for new functionality. In this paper, we introduce Git-Thetaâ€™s
  design and features and include an example use-case of Git-Theta where a pre-trained
  model is continually adapted and modified. We publicly release Git-Theta in hopes
  of kickstarting a new era of collaborative model development. https://github.com/r-three/git-theta/
