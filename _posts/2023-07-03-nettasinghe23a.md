title: Extending Conformal Prediction to Hidden Markov Models with Exact Validity
  via de Finetti’s Theorem for Markov Chains
openreview: Wf3MKy02wv
abstract: Conformal prediction is a widely used method to quantify the uncertainty
  of a classifier under the assumption of exchangeability (e.g., IID data). We generalize
  conformal prediction to the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework where the assumption
  of exchangeability is not valid. The key idea of the proposed method is to partition
  the non-exchangeable Markovian data from the HMM into exchangeable blocks by exploiting
  the de Finetti’s Theorem for Markov Chains discovered by Diaconis and Freedman (1980).
  The permutations of the exchangeable blocks are viewed as randomizations of the
  observed Markovian data from the HMM. The proposed method provably retains all desirable
  theoretical guarantees offered by the classical conformal prediction framework in
  both exchangeable and Markovian settings. In particular, while the lack of exchangeability
  introduced by Markovian samples constitutes a violation of a crucial assumption
  for classical conformal prediction, the proposed method views it as an advantage
  that can be exploited to improve the performance further. Detailed numerical and
  empirical results that complement the theoretical conclusions are provided to illustrate
  the practical feasibility of the proposed method.
