title: Efficient Sequence Transduction by Jointly Predicting Tokens and Durations
openreview: WGh9xjJ0z8
abstract: This paper introduces a novel Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) architecture
  for sequence-to-sequence tasks. TDT extends conventional RNN-Transducer architectures
  by jointly predicting both a token and its duration, i.e. the number of input frames
  covered by the emitted token. This is achieved by using a joint network with two
  outputs which are independently normalized to generate distributions over tokens
  and durations. During inference, TDT models can skip input frames guided by the
  predicted duration output, which makes them significantly faster than conventional
  Transducers which process the encoder output frame by frame. TDT models achieve
  both better accuracy and significantly faster inference than conventional Transducers
  on different sequence transduction tasks. TDT models for Speech Recognition achieve
  better accuracy and up to 2.82X faster inference than conventional Transducers.
  TDT models for Speech Translation achieve an absolute gain of over 1 BLEU on the
  MUST-C test compared with conventional Transducers, and its inference is 2.27X faster.
  In Speech Intent Classification and Slot Filling tasks, TDT models improve the intent
  accuracy by up to over 1% (absolute) over conventional Transducers, while running
  up to 1.28X faster. Our implementation of the TDT model will be open-sourced with
  the NeMo (https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) toolkit.
