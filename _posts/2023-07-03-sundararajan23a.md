title: Inflow, Outflow, and Reciprocity in Machine Learning
openreview: 9PJ2V6qvQL
abstract: Data is pooled across entities (individuals or enterprises) to create machine
  learning models, and sometimes, the entities that contribute the data also benefit
  from the models. Consider for instance a recommender system (e.g. Spotify, Instagram
  or YouTube), a health care app that predicts the risk for some disease, or a service
  built by pooling data across enterprises. In this work we propose a framework to
  study this value exchange, i.e., we model and measure contributions (outflows),
  benefits (inflows) and the balance between contributions and benefits (the degree
  of reciprocity). We show theoretically, and via experiments that under certain distributional
  assumptions, some classes of models are approximately reciprocal. These results
  only scratch the surface; we conclude with several open directions.
