title: 'Minimax estimation of discontinuous optimal transport maps: The semi-discrete
  case'
openreview: 2zIlKYx6iV
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the optimal transport map between
  two probability distributions, $P$ and $Q$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, on the basis of i.i.d.
  samples. All existing statistical analyses of this problem require the assumption
  that the transport map is Lipschitz, a strong requirement that, in particular, excludes
  any examples where the transport map is discontinuous. As a first step towards developing
  estimation procedures for discontinuous maps, we consider the important special
  case where the data distribution $Q$ is a discrete measure supported on a finite
  number of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We study a computationally efficient estimator
  initially proposed by (Pooladian & Niles-Weed, 2021), based on entropic optimal
  transport, and show in the semi-discrete setting that it converges at the minimax-optimal
  rate $n^{-1/2}$, independent of dimension. Other standard map estimation techniques
  both lack finite-sample guarantees in this setting and provably suffer from the
  curse of dimensionality. We confirm these results in numerical experiments, and
  provide experiments for other settings, not covered by our theory, which indicate
  that the entropic estimator is a promising methodology for other discontinuous transport
  map estimation problems.
