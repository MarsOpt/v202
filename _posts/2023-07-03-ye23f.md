title: 'FedDisco: Federated Learning with Discrepancy-Aware Collaboration'
openreview: cHJ1VuZorx
abstract: This work considers the category distribution heterogeneity in federated
  learning. This issue is due to biased labeling preferences at multiple clients and
  is a typical setting of data heterogeneity. To alleviate this issue, most previous
  works consider either regularizing local models or fine-tuning the global model,
  while they ignore the adjustment of aggregation weights and simply assign weights
  based on the dataset size. However, based on our empirical observations and theoretical
  analysis, we find that the dataset size is not optimal and the discrepancy between
  local and global category distributions could be a beneficial and complementary
  indicator for determining aggregation weights. We thus propose a novel aggregation
  method, Federated Learning with Discrepancy-Aware Collaboration (FedDisco), whose
  aggregation weights not only involve both the dataset size and the discrepancy value,
  but also contribute to a tighter theoretical upper bound of the optimization error.
  FedDisco can promote utility and modularity in a communication- and computation-efficient
  way. Extensive experiments show that our FedDisco outperforms several state-of-the-art
  methods and can be easily incorporated with many existing methods to further enhance
  the performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/FedDisco.
