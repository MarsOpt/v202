title: 'Feature Directions Matter: Long-Tailed Learning via Rotated Balanced Representation'
openreview: 8YxuCY7BuH
abstract: 'Long-tailed learning is one of the most challenging problems in visual
  recognition. There are some studies aiming to solve long-tailed classification from
  the perspective of feature learning. Recent work proposes to learn the balanced
  representation by fixing the linear classifier as Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF),
  since they argue what matters in classification is the structure of the feature,
  instead of their directions. Holding a different view, in this paper, we show that
  features with fixed directions may be harmful to the generalization of models, even
  if it is completely symmetric. To avoid this issue, we propose Representation-Balanced
  Learning Framework (RBL), which introduces orthogonal matrices to learn directions
  while maintaining the geometric structure of ETF. Theoretically, our contributions
  are two-fold: 1). we point out that the feature learning of RBL is insensitive toward
  training set label distribution, it always learns a balanced representation space.
  2). we provide a generalization analysis of proposed RBL through training stability.
  To analyze the stability of the parameter with orthogonal constraint, we propose
  a novel training stability analysis paradigm, Two-Parameter Model Stability. Practically,
  our method is extremely simple in implementation but shows great superiority on
  several benchmark datasets.'
