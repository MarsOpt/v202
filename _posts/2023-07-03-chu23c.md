title: Multiply Robust Off-policy Evaluation and Learning under Truncation by Death
openreview: FQlsEvyQ4N
abstract: Typical off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) are not
  well-defined problems under "truncation by death", where the outcome of interest
  is not defined after some events, such as death. The standard OPE no longer yields
  consistent estimators, and the standard OPL results in suboptimal policies. In this
  paper, we formulate OPE and OPL using principal stratification under "truncation
  by death". We propose a survivor value function for a subpopulation whose outcomes
  are always defined regardless of treatment conditions. We establish a novel identification
  strategy under principal ignorability, and derive the semiparametric efficiency
  bound of an OPE estimator. Then, we propose multiply robust estimators for OPE and
  OPL. We show that the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal
  even with flexible semi/nonparametric models for nuisance functions approximation.
  Moreover, under mild rate conditions of nuisance functions approximation, the estimators
  achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound. Finally, we conduct experiments to
  demonstrate the empirical performance of the proposed estimators.
