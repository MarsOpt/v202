title: 'AdaptDiffuser: Diffusion Models as Adaptive Self-evolving Planners'
openreview: 3ETNXs54HB
abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated their powerful generative capability
  in many tasks, with great potential to serve as a paradigm for offline reinforcement
  learning. However, the quality of the diffusion model is limited by the insufficient
  diversity of training data, which hinders the performance of planning and the generalizability
  to new tasks. This paper introduces AdaptDiffuser, an evolutionary planning method
  with diffusion that can self-evolve to improve the diffusion model hence a better
  planner, not only for seen tasks but can also adapt to unseen tasks. AdaptDiffuser
  enables the generation of rich synthetic expert data for goal-conditioned tasks
  using guidance from reward gradients. It then selects high-quality data via a discriminator
  to finetune the diffusion model, which improves the generalization ability to unseen
  tasks. Empirical experiments on two benchmark environments and two carefully designed
  unseen tasks in KUKA industrial robot arm and Maze2D environments demonstrate the
  effectiveness of AdaptDiffuser. For example, AdaptDiffuser not only outperforms
  the previous art Diffuser by 20.8% on Maze2D and 7.5% on MuJoCo locomotion, but
  also adapts better to new tasks, e.g., KUKA pick-and-place, by 27.9% without requiring
  additional expert data. More visualization results and demo videos could be found
  on our project page.
