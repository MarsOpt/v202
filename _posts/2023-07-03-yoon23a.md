title: 'EM-Network: Oracle Guided Self-distillation for Sequence Learning'
openreview: gxzAtub4sb
abstract: 'We introduce EM-Network, a novel self-distillation approach that effectively
  leverages target information for supervised sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning.
  In contrast to conventional methods, it is trained with oracle guidance, which is
  derived from the target sequence. Since the oracle guidance compactly represents
  the target-side context that can assist the sequence model in solving the task,
  the EM-Network achieves a better prediction compared to using only the source input.
  To allow the sequence model to inherit the promising capability of the EM-Network,
  we propose a new self-distillation strategy, where the original sequence model can
  benefit from the knowledge of the EM-Network in a one-stage manner. We conduct comprehensive
  experiments on two types of seq2seq models: connectionist temporal classification
  (CTC) for speech recognition and attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) for machine
  translation. Experimental results demonstrate that the EM-Network significantly
  advances the current state-of-the-art approaches, improving over the best prior
  work on speech recognition and establishing state-of-the-art performance on WMT’14
  and IWSLT’14.'
