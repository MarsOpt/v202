title: 'Team Belief DAG: Generalizing the Sequence Form to Team Games for Fast Computation
  of Correlated Team Max-Min Equilibria via Regret Minimization'
openreview: VZK4LLr78f
abstract: A classic result in the theory of extensive-form games asserts that the
  set of strategies available to any perfect-recall player is strategically equivalent
  to a low-dimensional convex polytope, called the <em>sequence-form polytope</em>.
  Online convex optimization tools operating on this polytope are the current state-of-the-art
  for computing several notions of equilibria in games, and have been crucial in landmark
  applications of computational game theory. However, when optimizing over the <em>joint</em>
  strategy space of a <em>team</em> of players, one cannot use the sequence form to
  obtain a strategically-equivalent convex description of the strategy set of the
  team. In this paper, we provide new complexity results on the computation of optimal
  strategies for teams, and propose a new representation, coined <em>team belief DAG
  (TB-DAG)</em>, that describes team strategies as a convex set. The TB-DAG enjoys
  state-of-the-art parameterized complexity bounds, while at the same time enjoying
  the advantages of efficient regret minimization techniques. We show that TB-DAG
  can be exponentially smaller and can be computed exponentially faster than all other
  known representations, and that the converse is never true. Experimentally, we show
  that the TB-DAG, when paired with learning techniques, yields state of the art on
  a wide variety of benchmark team games.
