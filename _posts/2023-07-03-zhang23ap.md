title: 'Towards Trustworthy Explanation: On Causal Rationalization'
openreview: fvTgh4MNUV
abstract: With recent advances in natural language processing, rationalization becomes
  an essential self-explaining diagram to disentangle the black box by selecting a
  subset of input texts to account for the major variation in prediction. Yet, existing
  association-based approaches on rationalization cannot identify true rationales
  when two or more snippets are highly inter-correlated and thus provide a similar
  contribution to prediction accuracy, so-called spuriousness. To address this limitation,
  we novelly leverage two causal desiderata, non-spuriousness and efficiency, into
  rationalization from the causal inference perspective. We formally define a series
  of probabilities of causation based on a newly proposed structural causal model
  of rationalization, with its theoretical identification established as the main
  component of learning necessary and sufficient rationales. The superior performance
  of the proposed causal rationalization is demonstrated on real-world review and
  medical datasets with extensive experiments compared to state-of-the-art methods.
