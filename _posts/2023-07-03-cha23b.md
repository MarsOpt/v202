title: 'Orthogonality-Enforced Latent Space in Autoencoders: An Approach to Learning
  Disentangled Representations'
openreview: RbKQdVX0Ht
abstract: Noting the importance of factorizing (or disentangling) the latent space,
  we propose a novel, non-probabilistic disentangling framework for autoencoders,
  based on the principles of symmetry transformations that are independent of one
  another. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic model that
  is aiming to achieve disentanglement based on autoencoders using only a reconstruction
  loss without pairs of images or labels, by explicitly introducing inductive biases
  into a model architecture through Euler encoding. The proposed model is then compared
  with a number of state-of-the-art models, relevant to disentanglement, including
  symmetry-based models and generative models. Our evaluation using six different
  disentanglement metrics, including the unsupervised disentanglement metric we propose
  here in this paper, shows that the proposed model can offer better disentanglement,
  especially when variances of the features are different, where other methods may
  struggle. We believe that this model opens several opportunities for linear disentangled
  representation learning based on deterministic autoencoders.
