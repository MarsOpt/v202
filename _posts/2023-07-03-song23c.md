title: 'Deep Perturbation Learning: Enhancing the Network Performance via Image Perturbations'
openreview: rziLKupkl3
abstract: Image perturbation technique is widely used to generate adversarial examples
  to attack networks, greatly decreasing the performance of networks. Unlike the existing
  works, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework Deep Perturbation Learning
  (DPL), the new insights into understanding image perturbations, to enhance the performance
  of networks rather than decrease the performance. Specifically, we learn image perturbations
  to amend the data distribution of training set to improve the performance of networks.
  This optimization w.r.t data distribution is non-trivial. To approach this, we tactfully
  construct a differentiable optimization target w.r.t. image perturbations via minimizing
  the empirical risk. Then we propose an alternating optimization of the network weights
  and perturbations. DPL can easily be adapted to a wide spectrum of downstream tasks
  and backbone networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  DPL on 6 datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR100, ImageNet, MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, and SBD) over
  3 popular vision tasks (image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation)
  with different backbone architectures (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, and ViT).
