title: Optimal Horizon-Free Reward-Free Exploration for Linear Mixture MDPs
openreview: VCe6WWB5Wg
abstract: 'We study reward-free reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation,
  where the agent works in two phases: (1) in the exploration phase, the agent interacts
  with the environment but cannot access the reward; and (2) in the planning phase,
  the agent is given a reward function and is expected to find a near-optimal policy
  based on samples collected in the exploration phase. The sample complexities of
  existing reward-free algorithms have a polynomial dependence on the planning horizon,
  which makes them intractable for long planning horizon RL problems. In this paper,
  we propose a new reward-free algorithm for learning linear mixture Markov decision
  processes (MDPs), where the transition probability can be parameterized as a linear
  combination of known feature mappings. At the core of our algorithm is uncertainty-weighted
  value-targeted regression with exploration-driven pseudo-reward and a high-order
  moment estimator for the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. When the total reward
  is bounded by $1$, we show that our algorithm only needs to explore $\tilde O\left(
  d^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ episodes to find an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy, where
  $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping. The sample complexity of our algorithm
  only has a polylogarithmic dependence on the planning horizon and therefore is "horizon-free‚Äù.
  In addition, we provide an $\Omega\left(d^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ sample complexity
  lower bound, which matches the sample complexity of our algorithm up to logarithmic
  factors, suggesting that our algorithm is optimal.'
