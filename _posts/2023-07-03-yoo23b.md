title: End-to-End Multi-Object Detection with a Regularized Mixture Model
openreview: fwT1ivw3Px
abstract: 'Recent end-to-end multi-object detectors simplify the inference pipeline
  by removing hand-crafted processes such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). However,
  during training, they still heavily rely on heuristics and hand-crafted processes
  which deteriorate the reliability of the predicted confidence score. In this paper,
  we propose a novel framework to train an end-to-end multi-object detector consisting
  of only two terms: negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a regularization term. In doing
  so, the multi-object detection problem is treated as density estimation of the ground
  truth bounding boxes utilizing a regularized mixture density model. The proposed
  end-to-end multi-object Detection with a Regularized Mixture Model (D-RMM) is trained
  by minimizing the NLL with the proposed regularization term, maximum component maximization
  (MCM) loss, preventing duplicate predictions. Our method reduces the heuristics
  of the training process and improves the reliability of the predicted confidence
  score. Moreover, our D-RMM outperforms the previous end-to-end detectors on MS COCO
  dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/lhj815/D-RMM.'
