title: Paging with Succinct Predictions
openreview: NG8f2j1EKb
abstract: Paging is a prototypical problem in the area of online algorithms. It has
  also played a central role in the development of learning-augmented algorithms.
  Previous work on learning-augmented paging has investigated predictions on (i) when
  the current page will be requested again (reoccurrence predictions), (ii) the current
  state of the cache in an optimal algorithm (state predictions), (iii) all requests
  until the current page gets requested again, and (iv) the relative order in which
  pages are requested. We study learning-augmented paging from the new perspective
  of requiring the least possible amount of predicted information. More specifically,
  the predictions obtained alongside each page request are limited to one bit only.
  We develop algorithms satisfy all three desirable properties of learning-augmented
  algorithms – that is, they are consistent, robust and smooth – despite being limited
  to a one-bit prediction per request. We also present lower bounds establishing that
  our algorithms are essentially best possible.
