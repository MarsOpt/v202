title: Low Complexity Homeomorphic Projection to Ensure Neural-Network Solution Feasibility
  for Optimization over (Non-)Convex Set
openreview: FfeDmgCZQ0
abstract: There has been growing interest in employing neural network (NN) to directly
  solve constrained optimization problems with low run-time complexity. However, it
  is non-trivial to ensure NN solutions strictly satisfying problem constraints due
  to inherent NN prediction errors. Existing feasibility-ensuring methods either are
  computationally expensive or lack performance guarantee. In this paper, we propose
  homeomorphic projection as a low-complexity scheme to guarantee NN solution feasibility
  for optimization over a general set homeomorphic to a unit ball, covering all compact
  convex sets and certain classes of nonconvex sets. The idea is to (i) learn a minimum
  distortion homeomorphic mapping between the constraint set and a unit ball using
  an invertible NN (INN), and then (ii) perform a simple bisection operation concerning
  the unit ball so that the INN-mapped final solution is feasible with respect to
  the constraint set with minor distortion-induced optimality loss. We prove the feasibility
  guarantee and bound the optimality loss under mild conditions. Simulation results,
  including those for non-convex AC-OPF problems in power grid operation, show that
  homeomorphic projection outperforms existing methods in solution feasibility and
  run-time complexity, while achieving similar optimality loss.
