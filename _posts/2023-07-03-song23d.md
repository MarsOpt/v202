title: Latent Traversals in Generative Models as Potential Flows
openreview: N9F5wG0hEu
abstract: Despite the significant recent progress in deep generative models, the underlying
  structure of their latent spaces is still poorly understood, thereby making the
  task of performing semantically meaningful latent traversals an open research challenge.
  Most prior work has aimed to solve this challenge by modeling latent structures
  linearly, and finding corresponding linear directions which result in ‘disentangled’
  generations. In this work, we instead propose to model latent structures with a
  learned dynamic potential landscape, thereby performing latent traversals as the
  flow of samples down the landscape’s gradient. Inspired by physics, optimal transport,
  and neuroscience, these potential landscapes are learned as physically realistic
  partial differential equations, thereby allowing them to flexibly vary over both
  space and time. To achieve disentanglement, multiple potentials are learned simultaneously,
  and are constrained by a classifier to be distinct and semantically self-consistent.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method achieves both more qualitatively
  and quantitatively disentangled trajectories than state-of-the-art baselines. Further,
  we demonstrate that our method can be integrated as a regularization term during
  training, thereby acting as an inductive bias towards the learning of structured
  representations, ultimately improving model likelihood on similarly structured data.
