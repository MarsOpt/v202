title: Gaussian Process Priors for Systems of Linear Partial Differential Equations
  with Constant Coefficients
openreview: 5ivhVPY8RC
abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are important tools to model physical
  systems and including them into machine learning models is an important way of incorporating
  physical knowledge. Given any system of linear PDEs with constant coefficients,
  we propose a family of Gaussian process (GP) priors, which we call EPGP, such that
  all realizations are exact solutions of this system. We apply the Ehrenpreis-Palamodov
  fundamental principle, which works as a non-linear Fourier transform, to construct
  GP kernels mirroring standard spectral methods for GPs. Our approach can infer probable
  solutions of linear PDE systems from any data such as noisy measurements, or pointwise
  defined initial and boundary conditions. Constructing EPGP-priors is algorithmic,
  generally applicable, and comes with a sparse version (S-EPGP) that learns the relevant
  spectral frequencies and works better for big data sets. We demonstrate our approach
  on three families of systems of PDEs, the heat equation, wave equation, and Maxwellâ€™s
  equations, where we improve upon the state of the art in computation time and precision,
  in some experiments by several orders of magnitude.
