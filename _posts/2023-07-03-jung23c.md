title: Estimating Joint Treatment Effects by Combining Multiple Experiments
openreview: vwrsCieL2Q
abstract: Estimating the effects of multi-dimensional treatments (i.e., joint treatment
  effects) is critical in many data-intensive domains, including genetics and drug
  evaluation. The main challenges for studying the joint treatment effects include
  the need for large sample sizes to explore different treatment combinations as well
  as potentially unsafe treatment interactions. In this paper, we develop machinery
  for estimating joint treatment effects by combining data from multiple experimental
  datasets. In particular, first, we develop new identification conditions for determining
  whether a joint treatment effect can be computed in terms of multiple interventional
  distributions under various scenarios. Further, we develop estimators with statistically
  appealing properties, including consistency and robustness to model misspecification
  and slow convergence. Finally, we perform simulation studies, which corroborate
  the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
