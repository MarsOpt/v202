title: Refining Generative Process with Discriminator Guidance in Score-based Diffusion
  Models
openreview: K1OvMEYEI4
abstract: The proposed method, <b>Discriminator Guidance</b>, aims to improve sample
  generation of pre-trained diffusion models. The approach introduces a discriminator
  that gives explicit supervision to a denoising sample path whether it is realistic
  or not. Unlike GANs, our approach does not require joint training of score and discriminator
  networks. Instead, we train the discriminator after score training, making discriminator
  training stable and fast to converge. In sample generation, we add an auxiliary
  term to the pre-trained score to deceive the discriminator. This term corrects the
  model score to the data score at the optimal discriminator, which implies that the
  discriminator helps better score estimation in a complementary way. Using our algorithm,
  we achive state-of-the-art results on ImageNet 256x256 with FID 1.83 and recall
  0.64, similar to the validation dataâ€™s FID (1.68) and recall (0.66). We release
  the code at https://github.com/alsdudrla10/DG.
