title: Towards Robust and Safe Reinforcement Learning with Benign Off-policy Data
openreview: LB0aNUgIaB
abstract: 'Previous work demonstrates that the optimal safe reinforcement learning
  policy in a noise-free environment is vulnerable and could be unsafe under observational
  attacks. While adversarial training effectively improves robustness and safety,
  collecting samples by attacking the behavior agent online could be expensive or
  prohibitively dangerous in many applications. We propose the robuSt vAriational
  ofF-policy lEaRning (SAFER) approach, which only requires benign training data without
  attacking the agent. SAFER obtains an optimal non-parametric variational policy
  distribution via convex optimization and then uses it to improve the parameterized
  policy robustly via supervised learning. The two-stage policy optimization facilitates
  robust training, and extensive experiments on multiple robot platforms show the
  efficiency of SAFER in learning a robust and safe policy: achieving the same reward
  with much fewer constraint violations during training than on-policy baselines.'
