title: Robust Satisficing MDPs
openreview: qw1UFuvGNR
abstract: Despite being a fundamental building block for reinforcement learning, Markov
  decision processes (MDPs) often suffer from ambiguity in model parameters. Robust
  MDPs are proposed to overcome this challenge by optimizing the worst-case performance
  under ambiguity. While robust MDPs can provide reliable policies with limited data,
  their worst-case performances are often overly conservative, and so they do not
  offer practical insights into the actual performance of these reliable policies.
  This paper proposes robust satisficing MDPs (RSMDPs), where the expected returns
  of feasible policies are softly-constrained to achieve a user-specified target under
  ambiguity. We derive a tractable reformulation for RSMDPs and develop a first-order
  method for solving large instances. Experimental results demonstrate that RSMDPs
  can prescribe policies to achieve their targets, which are much higher than the
  optimal worst-case returns computed by robust MDPs. Moreover, the average and percentile
  performances of our model are competitive among other models. We also demonstrate
  the scalability of the proposed algorithm compared with a state-of-the-art commercial
  solver.
