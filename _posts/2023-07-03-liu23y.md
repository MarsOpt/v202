title: Averaged Method of Multipliers for Bi-Level Optimization without Lower-Level
  Strong Convexity
openreview: Om06PEbWu6
abstract: Gradient methods have become mainstream techniques for Bi-Level Optimization
  (BLO) in learning fields. The validity of existing works heavily rely on either
  a restrictive Lower- Level Strong Convexity (LLSC) condition or on solving a series
  of approximation subproblems with high accuracy or both. In this work, by averaging
  the upper and lower level objectives, we propose a single loop Bi-level Averaged
  Method of Multipliers (sl-BAMM) for BLO that is simple yet efficient for large-scale
  BLO and gets rid of the limited LLSC restriction. We further provide non-asymptotic
  convergence analysis of sl-BAMM towards KKT stationary points, and the comparative
  advantage of our analysis lies in the absence of strong gradient boundedness assumption,
  which is always required by others. Thus our theory safely captures a wider variety
  of applications in deep learning, especially where the upper-level objective is
  quadratic w.r.t. the lower-level variable. Experimental results demonstrate the
  superiority of our method.
