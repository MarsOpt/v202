title: Efficient Approximations of Complete Interatomic Potentials for Crystal Property
  Prediction
openreview: jxI4CulNr1
abstract: We study property prediction for crystal materials. A crystal structure
  consists of a minimal unit cell that is repeated infinitely in 3D space. How to
  accurately represent such repetitive structures in machine learning models remains
  unresolved. Current methods construct graphs by establishing edges only between
  nearby nodes, thereby failing to faithfully capture infinite repeating patterns
  and distant interatomic interactions. In this work, we propose several innovations
  to overcome these limitations. First, we propose to model physics-principled interatomic
  potentials directly instead of only using distances as in many existing methods.
  These potentials include the Coulomb potential, London dispersion potential, and
  Pauli repulsion potential. Second, we model the complete set of potentials among
  all atoms, instead of only between nearby atoms as in existing methods. This is
  enabled by our approximations of infinite potential summations with provable error
  bounds. We further develop efficient algorithms to compute the approximations. Finally,
  we propose to incorporate our computations of complete interatomic potentials into
  message passing neural networks for representation learning. We perform experiments
  on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks for evaluation. Results show that
  the use of interatomic potentials and complete interatomic potentials leads to consistent
  performance improvements with reasonable computational costs. Our code is publicly
  available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).
