title: Detecting Out-of-distribution Data through In-distribution Class Prior
openreview: charggEv8v
abstract: 'Given a pre-trained in-distribution (ID) model, the inference-time out-of-distribution
  (OOD) detection aims to recognize OOD data during the inference stage. However,
  some representative methods share an unproven assumption that the probability that
  OOD data belong to every ID class should be the same, i.e., these OOD-to-ID probabilities
  actually form a uniform distribution. In this paper, we show that this assumption
  makes the above methods incapable when the ID model is trained with class-imbalanced
  data.Fortunately, by analyzing the causal relations between ID/OOD classes and features,
  we identify several common scenarios where the OOD-to-ID probabilities should be
  the ID-class-prior distribution and propose two strategies to modify existing inference-time
  detection methods: 1) replace the uniform distribution with the ID-class-prior distribution
  if they explicitly use the uniform distribution; 2) otherwise, reweight their scores
  according to the similarity between the ID-class-prior distribution and the softmax
  outputs of the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments show that both strategies
  can improve the OOD detection performance when the ID model is pre-trained with
  imbalanced data, reflecting the importance of ID-class prior in OOD detection.'
