title: Are Neurons Actually Collapsed? On the Fine-Grained Structure in Neural Representations
openreview: lwodnXJzu6
abstract: Recent work has observed an intriguing "Neural Collapse‚Äù phenomenon in well-trained
  neural networks, where the last-layer representations of training samples with the
  same label collapse into each other. This appears to suggest that the last-layer
  representations are completely determined by the labels, and do not depend on the
  intrinsic structure of input distribution. We provide evidence that this is not
  a complete description, and that the apparent collapse hides important fine-grained
  structure in the representations. Specifically, even when representations apparently
  collapse, the small amount of remaining variation can still faithfully and accurately
  captures the intrinsic structure of input distribution. As an example, if we train
  on CIFAR-10 using only 5 coarse-grained labels (by combining two classes into one
  super-class) until convergence, we can reconstruct the original 10-class labels
  from the learned representations via unsupervised clustering. The reconstructed
  labels achieve 93% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 test set, nearly matching the normal
  CIFAR-10 accuracy for the same architecture. We also provide an initial theoretical
  result showing the fine-grained representation structure in a simplified synthetic
  setting. Our results show concretely how the structure of input data can play a
  significant role in determining the fine-grained structure of neural representations,
  going beyond what Neural Collapse predicts.
