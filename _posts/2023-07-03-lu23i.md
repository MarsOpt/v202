title: Federated Conformal Predictors for Distributed Uncertainty Quantification
openreview: YVTr9PzIrK
abstract: Conformal prediction is emerging as a popular paradigm for providing rigorous
  uncertainty quantification in machine learning since it can be easily applied as
  a post-processing step to already trained models. In this paper, we extend conformal
  prediction to the federated learning setting. The main challenge we face is data
  heterogeneity across the clients â€” this violates the fundamental tenet of <em>exchangeability</em>
  required for conformal prediction. We propose a weaker notion of <em>partial exchangeability</em>,
  better suited to the FL setting, and use it to develop the Federated Conformal Prediction
  (FCP) framework. We show FCP enjoys rigorous theoretical guarantees and excellent
  empirical performance on several computer vision and medical imaging datasets. Our
  results demonstrate a practical approach to incorporating meaningful uncertainty
  quantification in distributed and heterogeneous environments. We provide code used
  in our experiments https://github.com/clu5/federated-conformal.
