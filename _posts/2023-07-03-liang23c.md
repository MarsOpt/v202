title: A Distribution Optimization Framework for Confidence Bounds of Risk Measures
openreview: 7zvVPRUri8
abstract: We present a distribution optimization framework that significantly improves
  confidence bounds for various risk measures compared to previous methods. Our framework
  encompasses popular risk measures such as the entropic risk measure, conditional
  value at risk (CVaR), spectral risk measure, distortion risk measure, equivalent
  certainty, and rank-dependent expected utility, which are well established in risk-sensitive
  decision-making literature. To achieve this, we introduce two estimation schemes
  based on concentration bounds derived from the empirical distribution, specifically
  using either the Wasserstein distance or the supremum distance. Unlike traditional
  approaches that add or subtract a confidence radius from the empirical risk measures,
  our proposed schemes evaluate a specific transformation of the empirical distribution
  based on the distance. Consequently, our confidence bounds consistently yield tighter
  results compared to previous methods. We further verify the efficacy of the proposed
  framework by providing tighter problem-dependent regret bound for the CVaR bandit.
