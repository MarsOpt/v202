title: 'Estimation Beyond Data Reweighting: Kernel Method of Moments'
openreview: UaVutjvcEl
abstract: Moment restrictions and their conditional counterparts emerge in many areas
  of machine learning and statistics ranging from causal inference to reinforcement
  learning. Estimators for these tasks, generally called methods of moments, include
  the prominent generalized method of moments (GMM) which has recently gained attention
  in causal inference. GMM is a special case of the broader family of empirical likelihood
  estimators which are based on approximating a population distribution by means of
  minimizing a $\varphi$-divergence to an empirical distribution. However, the use
  of $\varphi$-divergences effectively limits the candidate distributions to reweightings
  of the data samples. We lift this long-standing limitation and provide a method
  of moments that goes beyond data reweighting. This is achieved by defining an empirical
  likelihood estimator based on maximum mean discrepancy which we term the kernel
  method of moments (KMM). We provide a variant of our estimator for conditional moment
  restrictions and show that it is asymptotically first-order optimal for such problems.
  Finally, we show that our method achieves competitive performance on several conditional
  moment restriction tasks.
