title: 'Implicit Graph Neural Networks: A Monotone Operator Viewpoint'
openreview: Q8k4WzGgnK
abstract: Implicit graph neural networks (IGNNs) – that solve a fixed-point equilibrium
  equation using Picard iteration for representation learning – have shown remarkable
  performance in learning long-range dependencies (LRD) in the underlying graphs.
  However, IGNNs suffer from several issues, including 1) their expressivity is limited
  by their parameterizations for the well-posedness guarantee, 2) IGNNs are unstable
  in learning LRD, and 3) IGNNs become computationally inefficient when learning LRD.
  In this paper, we provide a new well-posedness characterization for IGNNs leveraging
  monotone operator theory, resulting in a much more expressive parameterization than
  the existing one. We also propose an orthogonal parameterization for IGNN based
  on Cayley transform to stabilize learning LRD. Furthermore, we leverage Anderson-accelerated
  operator splitting schemes to efficiently solve for the fixed point of the equilibrium
  equation of IGNN with monotone or orthogonal parameterization. We verify the computational
  efficiency and accuracy of the new models over existing IGNNs on various graph learning
  tasks at both graph and node levels.
