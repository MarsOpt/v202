title: Semi-Parametric Contextual Pricing Algorithm using Cox Proportional Hazards
  Model
openreview: wkr4r2Cw3i
abstract: Contextual dynamic pricing is a problem of setting prices based on current
  contextual information and previous sales history to maximize revenue. A popular
  approach is to postulate a distribution of customer valuation as a function of contextual
  information and the baseline valuation. A semi-parametric setting, where the context
  effect is parametric and the baseline is nonparametric, is of growing interest due
  to its flexibility. A challenge is that customer valuation is almost never observable
  in practice and is instead <em>type-I interval censored</em> by the offered price.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-parametric contextual pricing
  algorithm for stochastic contexts, called the epoch-based Cox proportional hazards
  Contextual Pricing (CoxCP) algorithm. To our best knowledge, our work is the first
  to employ the Cox model for customer valuation. The CoxCP algorithm has a high-probability
  regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}( T^{\frac{2}{3}}d )$, where $T$ is the length of
  horizon and $d$ is the dimension of context. In addition, if the baseline is known,
  the regret bound can improve to $O( d \log T )$ under certain assumptions. We demonstrate
  empirically the proposed algorithm performs better than existing semi-parametric
  contextual pricing algorithms when the model assumptions of all algorithms are correct.
