title: Probabilistic Attention-to-Influence Neural Models for Event Sequences
openreview: jFPdftHG4F
abstract: Discovering knowledge about which types of events influence others, using
  datasets of event sequences without time stamps, has several practical applications.
  While neural sequence models are able to capture complex and potentially long-range
  historical dependencies, they often lack the interpretability of simpler models
  for event sequence dynamics. We provide a novel neural framework in such a setting
  - a probabilistic attention-to-influence neural model - which not only captures
  complex instance-wise interactions between events but also learns influencers for
  each event type of interest. Given event sequence data and a prior distribution
  on type-wise influence, we efficiently learn an approximate posterior for type-wise
  influence by an attention-to-influence transformation using variational inference.
  Our method subsequently models the conditional likelihood of sequences by sampling
  the above posterior to focus attention on influencing event types. We motivate our
  general framework and show improved performance in experiments compared to existing
  baselines on synthetic data as well as real-world benchmarks, for tasks involving
  prediction and influencing set identification.
