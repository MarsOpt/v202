title: Discovering Object-Centric Generalized Value Functions From Pixels
openreview: WtXN9bQqWl
abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown significant progress in extracting
  useful representations from high-dimensional inputs albeit using hand-crafted auxiliary
  tasks and pseudo rewards. Automatically learning such representations in an object-centric
  manner geared towards control and fast adaptation remains an open research problem.
  In this paper, we introduce a method that tries to discover meaningful features
  from objects, translating them to temporally coherent ‘question’ functions and leveraging
  the subsequent learned general value functions for control. We compare our approach
  with state-of-the-art techniques alongside other ablations and show competitive
  performance in both stationary and non-stationary settings. Finally, we also investigate
  the discovered general value functions and through qualitative analysis show that
  the learned representations are not only interpretable but also, centered around
  objects that are invariant to changes across tasks facilitating fast adaptation.
