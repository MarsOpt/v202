title: 'BNN-DP: Robustness Certification of Bayesian Neural Networks via Dynamic Programming'
openreview: wHPDEyYEps
abstract: In this paper, we introduce BNN-DP, an efficient algorithmic framework for
  analysis of adversarial robustness of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Given a compact
  set of input points $T\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, BNN-DP computes lower and upper bounds
  on the BNNâ€™s predictions for all the points in $T$. The framework is based on an
  interpretation of BNNs as stochastic dynamical systems, which enables the use of
  Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms to bound the prediction range along the layers
  of the network. Specifically, the method uses bound propagation techniques and convex
  relaxations to derive a backward recursion procedure to over-approximate the prediction
  range of the BNN with piecewise affine functions. The algorithm is general and can
  handle both regression and classification tasks. On a set of experiments on various
  regression and classification tasks and BNN architectures, we show that BNN-DP outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods by up to four orders of magnitude in both tightness of
  the bounds and computational efficiency.
