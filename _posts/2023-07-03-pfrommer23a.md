title: The Power of Learned Locally Linear Models for Nonlinear Policy Optimization
openreview: 631FTQB0UB
abstract: A common pipeline in learning-based control is to iteratively estimate a
  model of system dynamics, and apply a trajectory optimization algorithm - e.g. $\mathtt{iLQR}$
  - on the learned model to minimize a target cost. This paper conducts a rigorous
  analysis of a simplified variant of this strategy for general nonlinear systems.
  We analyze an algorithm which iterates between estimating local linear models of
  nonlinear system dynamics and performing $\mathtt{iLQR}$-like policy updates. We
  demonstrate that this algorithm attains sample complexity polynomial in relevant
  problem parameters, and, by synthesizing locally stabilizing gains, overcomes exponential
  dependence in problem horizon. Experimental results validate the performance of
  our algorithm, and compare to natural deep-learning baselines.
