title: 'Diffusion Models as Artists: Are we Closing the Gap between Humans and Machines?'
openreview: Aev7tepsqx
abstract: An important milestone for AI is the development of algorithms that can
  produce drawings that are indistinguishable from those of humans. Here, we adapt
  the ”diversity vs. recognizability” scoring framework from Boutin et al (2022) and
  find that one-shot diffusion models have indeed started to close the gap between
  humans and machines. However, using a finer-grained measure of the originality of
  individual samples, we show that strengthening the guidance of diffusion models
  helps improve the humanness of their drawings, but they still fall short of approximating
  the originality and recognizability of human drawings. Comparing human category
  diagnostic features, collected through an online psychophysics experiment, against
  those derived from diffusion models reveals that humans rely on fewer and more localized
  features. Overall, our study suggests that diffusion models have significantly helped
  improve the quality of machine-generated drawings; however, a gap between humans
  and machines remains – in part explainable by discrepancies in visual strategies.
