title: Byzantine-Robust Learning on Heterogeneous Data via Gradient Splitting
openreview: 3DI6Kmw81p
abstract: 'Federated learning has exhibited vulnerabilities to Byzantine attacks,
  where the Byzantine attackers can send arbitrary gradients to a central server to
  destroy the convergence and performance of the global model. A wealth of robust
  AGgregation Rules (AGRs) have been proposed to defend against Byzantine attacks.
  However, Byzantine clients can still circumvent robust AGRs when data is non-Identically
  and Independently Distributed (non-IID). In this paper, we first reveal the root
  causes of performance degradation of current robust AGRs in non-IID settings: the
  curse of dimensionality and gradient heterogeneity. In order to address this issue,
  we propose GAS, a GrAdient Splitting approach that can successfully adapt existing
  robust AGRs to non-IID settings. We also provide a detailed convergence analysis
  when the existing robust AGRs are combined with GAS. Experiments on various real-world
  datasets verify the efficacy of our proposed GAS. The implementation code is provided
  in https://github.com/YuchenLiu-a/byzantine-gas.'
