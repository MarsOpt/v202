title: Cooperative Open-ended Learning Framework for Zero-Shot Coordination
openreview: iMVMxYab0z
abstract: Zero-shot coordination in cooperative artificial intelligence (AI) remains
  a significant challenge, which means effectively coordinating with a wide range
  of unseen partners. Previous algorithms have attempted to address this challenge
  by optimizing fixed objectives within a population to improve strategy or behaviour
  diversity. However, these approaches can result in a loss of learning and an inability
  to cooperate with certain strategies within the population, known as cooperative
  incompatibility. To address this issue, we propose the Cooperative Open-ended LEarning
  (COLE) framework, which constructs open-ended objectives in cooperative games with
  two players from the perspective of graph theory to assess and identify the cooperative
  ability of each strategy. We further specify the framework and propose a practical
  algorithm that leverages knowledge from game theory and graph theory. Furthermore,
  an analysis of the learning process of the algorithm shows that it can efficiently
  overcome cooperative incompatibility. The experimental results in the Overcooked
  game environment demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
  methods when coordinating with different-level partners. Our demo is available at
