title: Stable and Consistent Prediction of 3D Characteristic Orientation via Invariant
  Residual Learning
openreview: 2DiRkdZJYm
abstract: Learning to predict reliable characteristic orientations of 3D point clouds
  is an important yet challenging problem, as different point clouds of the same class
  may have largely varying appearances. In this work, we introduce a novel method
  to decouple the shape geometry and semantics of the input point cloud to achieve
  both stability and consistency. The proposed method integrates shape-geometry-based
  SO(3)-equivariant learning and shape-semantics-based SO(3)-invariant residual learning,
  where a final characteristic orientation is obtained by calibrating an SO(3)-equivariant
  orientation hypothesis using an SO(3)-invariant residual rotation. In experiments,
  the proposed method not only demonstrates superior stability and consistency but
  also exhibits state-of-the-art performances when applied to point cloud part segmentation,
  given randomly rotated inputs.
