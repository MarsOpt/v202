title: Sample Complexity Bounds for Learning High-dimensional Simplices in Noisy Regimes
openreview: 0YGT8Bqpoa
abstract: In this paper, we propose sample complexity bounds for learning a simplex
  from noisy samples. A dataset of size $n$ is given which includes i.i.d. samples
  drawn from a uniform distribution over an unknown arbitrary simplex in $\mathbb{R}^K$,
  where samples are assumed to be corrupted by a multi-variate additive Gaussian noise
  of an arbitrary magnitude. We prove the existence of an algorithm that with high
  probability outputs a simplex having a $\ell_2$ distance of at most $\varepsilon$
  from the true simplex (for any $\varepsilon>0$). Also, we theoretically show that
  in order to achieve this bound, it is sufficient to have $n\ge\tilde{\Omega}\left(K^2/\varepsilon^2\right)e^{\Omega\left(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2\right)}$
  samples, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ stands for the signal-to-noise ratio and is defined
  as the ratio of the maximum component-wise standard deviation of the simplex (signal)
  to that of the noise vector. This result solves an important open problem in this
  area of research, and shows as long as $\mathrm{SNR}\ge\Omega\left(\sqrt{K}\right)$
  the sample complexity of the noisy regime has the same order to that of the noiseless
  case. Our proofs are a combination of the so-called sample compression technique
  in (Ashtiani et al., 2018), mathematical tools from high-dimensional geometry, and
  Fourier analysis. In particular, we have proposed a general Fourier-based technique
  for recovery of a more general class of distribution families from additive Gaussian
  noise, which can be further used in a variety of other related problems.
