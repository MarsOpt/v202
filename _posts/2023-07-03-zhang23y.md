title: 'Fed-CBS: A Heterogeneity-Aware Client Sampling Mechanism for Federated Learning
  via Class-Imbalance Reduction'
openreview: NcbY2UOfko
abstract: Due to the often limited communication bandwidth of edge devices, most existing
  federated learning (FL) methods randomly select only a subset of devices to participate
  in training at each communication round. Compared with engaging all the available
  clients, such a random-selection mechanism could lead to significant performance
  degradation on non-IID (independent and identically distributed) data. In this paper,
  we present our key observation that the essential reason resulting in such performance
  degradation is the class-imbalance of the grouped data from randomly selected clients.
  Based on this observation, we design an efficient heterogeneity-aware client sampling
  mechanism, namely, Federated Class-balanced Sampling (Fed-CBS), which can effectively
  reduce class-imbalance of the grouped dataset from the intentionally selected clients.
  We first propose a measure of class-imbalance which can be derived in a privacy-preserving
  way. Based on this measure, we design a computation-efficient client sampling strategy
  such that the actively selected clients will generate a more class-balanced grouped
  dataset with theoretical guarantees. Experimental results show that Fed-CBS outperforms
  the status quo approaches in terms of test accuracy and the rate of convergence
  while achieving comparable or even better performance than the ideal setting where
  all the available clients participate in the FL training.
