title: Revisiting the Linear-Programming Framework for Offline RL with General Function
  Approximation
openreview: LxkOVVGQYq
abstract: 'Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy for
  sequential decision-making using a pre-collected dataset, without further interaction
  with the environment. Recent theoretical progress has focused on developing sample-efficient
  offline RL algorithms with various relaxed assumptions on data coverage and function
  approximators, especially to handle the case with excessively large state-action
  spaces. Among them, the framework based on the linear-programming (LP) reformulation
  of Markov decision processes has shown promise: it enables sample-efficient offline
  RL with function approximation, under only partial data coverage and realizability
  assumptions on the function classes, with favorable computational tractability.
  In this work, we revisit the LP framework for offline RL, and provide a new reformulation
  that advances the existing results in several aspects, relaxing certain assumptions
  and achieving optimal statistical rates in terms of sample size. Our key enabler
  is to introduce proper constraints in the reformulation, instead of using any regularization
  as in the literature, also with careful choices of the function classes and initial
  state distributions. We hope our insights bring into light the use of LP formulations
  and the induced primal-dual minimax optimization, in offline RL.'
