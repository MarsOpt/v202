title: Multi-Task Off-Policy Learning from Bandit Feedback
openreview: a35tteW8if
abstract: Many practical problems involve solving similar tasks. In recommender systems,
  the tasks can be users with similar preferences; in search engines, the tasks can
  be items with similar affinities. To learn statistically efficiently, the tasks
  can be organized in a hierarchy, where the task affinity is captured using an unknown
  latent parameter. We study the problem of off-policy learning for similar tasks
  from logged bandit feedback. To solve the problem, we propose a hierarchical off-policy
  optimization algorithm HierOPO. The key idea is to estimate the task parameters
  using the hierarchy and then act pessimistically with respect to them. To analyze
  the algorithm, we develop novel Bayesian error bounds. Our bounds are the first
  in off-policy learning that improve with a more informative prior and capture statistical
  gains due to hierarchical models. Therefore, they are of a general interest. HierOPO
  also performs well in practice. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of using
  the hierarchy over solving each task independently.
