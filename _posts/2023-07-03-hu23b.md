title: Omnipredictors for Constrained Optimization
openreview: e5GpygwvXj
abstract: The notion of omnipredictors (Gopalan, Kalai, Reingold, Sharan and Wieder
  ITCS 2022), suggested a new paradigm for loss minimization. Rather than learning
  a predictor based on a known loss function, omnipredictors can easily be post-processed
  to minimize any one of a rich family of loss functions compared with the loss of
  hypotheses in a class $\mathcal C$. It has been shown that such omnipredictors exist
  and are implied (for all convex and Lipschitz loss functions) by the notion of multicalibration
  from the algorithmic fairness literature. In this paper, we introduce omnipredictors
  for constrained optimization and study their complexity and implications. The notion
  that we introduce allows the learner to be unaware of the loss function that will
  be later assigned <em>as well as the constraints that will be later imposed</em>,
  as long as the subpopulations that are used to define these constraints are known.
  We show how to obtain omnipredictors for constrained optimization problems, relying
  on appropriate variants of multicalibration. We also investigate the implications
  of this notion when the constraints used are so-called group fairness notions.
