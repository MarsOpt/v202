title: Unveiling The Mask of Position-Information Pattern Through the Mist of Image
  Features
openreview: iMHNLJRSVz
abstract: Recent studies have shown that paddings in convolutional neural networks
  encode absolute position information which can negatively affect the model performance
  for certain tasks. However, existing metrics for quantifying the strength of positional
  information remain unreliable and frequently lead to erroneous results. To address
  this issue, we propose novel metrics for measuring and visualizing the encoded positional
  information. We formally define the encoded information as Position-information
  Pattern from Padding (PPP) and conduct a series of experiments to study its properties
  as well as its formation. The proposed metrics measure the presence of positional
  information more reliably than the existing metrics based on PosENet and tests in
  F-Conv. We also demonstrate that for any extant (and proposed) padding schemes,
  PPP is primarily a learning artifact and is less dependent on the characteristics
  of the underlying padding schemes.
