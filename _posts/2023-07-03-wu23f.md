title: Solving High-Dimensional PDEs with Latent Spectral Models
openreview: GwBsk5F1ti
abstract: Deep models have achieved impressive progress in solving partial differential
  equations (PDEs). A burgeoning paradigm is learning neural operators to approximate
  the input-output mappings of PDEs. While previous deep models have explored the
  multiscale architectures and various operator designs, they are limited to learning
  the operators as a whole in the coordinate space. In real physical science problems,
  PDEs are complex coupled equations with numerical solvers relying on discretization
  into high-dimensional coordinate space, which cannot be precisely approximated by
  a single operator nor efficiently learned due to the curse of dimensionality. We
  present Latent Spectral Models (LSM) toward an efficient and precise solver for
  high-dimensional PDEs. Going beyond the coordinate space, LSM enables an attention-based
  hierarchical projection network to reduce the high-dimensional data into a compact
  latent space in linear time. Inspired by classical spectral methods in numerical
  analysis, we design a neural spectral block to solve PDEs in the latent space that
  approximates complex input-output mappings via learning multiple basis operators,
  enjoying nice theoretical guarantees for convergence and approximation. Experimentally,
  LSM achieves consistent state-of-the-art and yields a relative gain of 11.5% averaged
  on seven benchmarks covering both solid and fluid physics. Code is available at
