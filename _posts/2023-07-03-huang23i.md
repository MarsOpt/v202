title: 'Make-An-Audio: Text-To-Audio Generation with Prompt-Enhanced Diffusion Models'
openreview: Srbl4AuTyd
abstract: 'Large-scale multimodal generative modeling has created milestones in text-to-image
  and text-to-video generation. Its application to audio still lags behind for two
  main reasons: the lack of large-scale datasets with high-quality text-audio pairs,
  and the complexity of modeling long continuous audio data. In this work, we propose
  Make-An-Audio with a prompt-enhanced diffusion model that addresses these gaps by
  1) introducing pseudo prompt enhancement with a distill-then-reprogram approach,
  it alleviates data scarcity with orders of magnitude concept compositions by using
  language-free audios; 2) leveraging spectrogram autoencoder to predict the self-supervised
  audio representation instead of waveforms. Together with robust contrastive language-audio
  pretraining (CLAP) representations, Make-An-Audio achieves state-of-the-art results
  in both objective and subjective benchmark evaluation. Moreover, we present its
  controllability and generalization for X-to-Audio with "No Modality Left Behind",
  for the first time unlocking the ability to generate high-definition, high-fidelity
  audios given a user-defined modality input. Audio samples are available at https://Make-An-Audio.github.io'
