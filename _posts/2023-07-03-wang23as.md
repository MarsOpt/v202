title: 'Enforcing Hard Constraints with Soft Barriers: Safe Reinforcement Learning
  in Unknown Stochastic Environments'
openreview: NbC9a9zS5K
abstract: It is quite challenging to ensure the safety of reinforcement learning (RL)
  agents in an unknown and stochastic environment under hard constraints that require
  the system state not to reach certain specified unsafe regions. Many popular safe
  RL methods such as those based on the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP)
  paradigm formulate safety violations in a cost function and try to constrain the
  expectation of cumulative cost under a threshold. However, it is often difficult
  to effectively capture and enforce hard reachability-based safety constraints indirectly
  with such constraints on safety violation cost. In this work, we leverage the notion
  of barrier function to explicitly encode the hard safety chance constraints, and
  given that the environment is unknown, relax them to our design of <em>generative-model-based
  soft barrier functions</em>. Based on such soft barriers, we propose a novel safe
  RL approach with bi-level optimization that can jointly learn the unknown environment
  and optimize the control policy, while effectively avoiding the unsafe region with
  safety probability optimization. Experiments on a set of examples demonstrate that
  our approach can effectively enforce hard safety chance constraints and significantly
  outperform CMDP-based baseline methods in system safe rates measured via simulations.
