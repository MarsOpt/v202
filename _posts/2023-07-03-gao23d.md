title: On the Impact of Algorithmic Recourse on Social Segregation
openreview: 4JCKwAiRPX
abstract: As predictive models seep into several real-world applications, it has become
  critical to ensure that individuals who are negatively impacted by the outcomes
  of these models are provided with a means for recourse. To this end, there has been
  a growing body of research on algorithmic recourse in recent years. While recourses
  can be extremely beneficial to affected individuals, their implementation at a large
  scale can lead to potential data distribution shifts and other unintended consequences.
  However, there is little to no research on understanding the impact of algorithmic
  recourse after implementation. In this work, we address the aforementioned gaps
  by making one of the first attempts at analyzing the delayed societal impact of
  algorithmic recourse. To this end, we theoretically and empirically analyze the
  recourses output by state-of-the-art algorithms. Our analysis demonstrates that
  large-scale implementation of recourses by end users may exacerbate social segregation.
  To address this problem, we propose novel algorithms which leverage implicit and
  explicit conditional generative models to not only minimize the chance of segregation
  but also provide realistic recourses. Extensive experimentation with real-world
  datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approaches.
