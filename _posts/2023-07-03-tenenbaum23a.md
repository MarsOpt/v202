title: Concurrent Shuffle Differential Privacy Under Continual Observation
openreview: pWeQdceMHL
abstract: We introduce the concurrent shuffle model of differential privacy. In this
  model we have multiple concurrent shufflers permuting messages from different, possibly
  overlapping, batches of users. Similarly to the standard (single) shuffler model,
  the privacy requirement is that the concatenation of all shuffled messages should
  be differentially private. We study the private continual summation problem (a.k.a.
  the counter problem) and show that the concurrent shuffle model allows for significantly
  improved error compared to a standard (single) shuffler model. Specifically, we
  give a summation algorithm with error $\tilde{O}(n^{1/(2k+1)})$ with $k$ concurrent
  shufflers on a sequence of length $n$. Furthermore, we prove that this bound is
  tight for any $k$, even if the algorithm can choose the sizes of the batches adaptively.
  For $k=\log n$ shufflers, the resulting error is polylogarithmic, much better than
  $\tilde{\Theta}(n^{1/3})$ which we show is the smallest possible with a single shuffler.
  We use our online summation algorithm to get algorithms with improved regret bounds
  for the contextual linear bandit problem. In particular we get optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$
  regret with $k= \tilde{\Omega}(\log n)$ concurrent shufflers.
