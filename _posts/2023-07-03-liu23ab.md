title: 'OMS-DPM: Optimizing the Model Schedule for Diffusion Probabilistic Models'
openreview: miv2ZYRd1t
abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) are a new class of generative models
  that have achieved state-of-the-art generation quality in various domains. Despite
  the promise, one major drawback of DPMs is the slow generation speed due to the
  large number of neural network evaluations required in the generation process. In
  this paper, we reveal an overlooked dimension—model schedule—for optimizing the
  trade-off between generation quality and speed. More specifically, we observe that
  small models, though having worse generation quality when used alone, could outperform
  large models in certain generation steps. Therefore, unlike the traditional way
  of using a single model, using different models in different generation steps in
  a carefully designed model schedule could potentially improve generation quality
  and speed simultaneously. We design OMS-DPM, a predictor-based search algorithm,
  to determine the optimal model schedule given an arbitrary generation time budget
  and a set of pre-trained models. We demonstrate that OMS-DPM can find model schedules
  that improve generation quality and speed than prior state-of-the-art methods across
  CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN datasets. When applied to the public checkpoints
  of the Stable Diffusion model, we are able to accelerate the sampling by 2x while
  maintaining the generation quality.
