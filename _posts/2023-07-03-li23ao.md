title: Achieving Hierarchy-Free Approximation for Bilevel Programs with Equilibrium
  Constraints
openreview: CeNkvR00rT
abstract: 'In this paper, we develop an approximation scheme for solving bilevel programs
  with equilibrium constraints, which are generally difficult to solve. Among other
  things, calculating the first-order derivative in such a problem requires differentiation
  across the hierarchy, which is computationally intensive, if not prohibitive. To
  bypass the hierarchy, we propose to bound such bilevel programs, equivalent to multiple-followers
  Stackelberg games, with two new hierarchy-free problems: a $T$-step Cournot game
  and a $T$-step monopoly model. Since they are standard equilibrium or optimization
  problems, both can be efficiently solved via first-order methods. Importantly, we
  show that the bounds provided by these problems — the upper bound by the $T$-step
  Cournot game and the lower bound by the $T$-step monopoly model — can be made arbitrarily
  tight by increasing the step parameter $T$ for a wide range of problems. We prove
  that a small $T$ usually suffices under appropriate conditions to reach an approximation
  acceptable for most practical purposes. Eventually, the analytical insights are
  highlighted through numerical examples.'
