title: A Robust Test for the Stationarity Assumption in Sequential Decision Making
openreview: KoIqF3Dztr
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique that allows an autonomous
  agent to learn an optimal policy to maximize the expected return. The optimality
  of various RL algorithms relies on the stationarity assumption, which requires time-invariant
  state transition and reward functions. However, deviations from stationarity over
  extended periods often occur in real-world applications like robotics control, health
  care and digital marketing, resulting in suboptimal policies learned under stationary
  assumptions. In this paper, we propose a model-based doubly robust procedure for
  testing the stationarity assumption and detecting change points in offline RL settings
  with certain degree of homogeneity. Our proposed testing procedure is robust to
  model misspecifications and can effectively control type-I error while achieving
  high statistical power, especially in high-dimensional settings. Extensive comparative
  simulations and a real-world interventional mobile health example illustrate the
  advantages of our method in detecting change points and optimizing long-term rewards
  in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments.
