title: Generative Pretraining for Black-Box Optimization
openreview: teVdwyjrVn
abstract: Many problems in science and engineering involve optimizing an expensive
  black-box function over a high-dimensional space. In the offline model-based optimization
  (MBO) setting, we assume access to a fixed, offline dataset for pretraining and
  a small budget for online function evaluations. Prior approaches seek to utilize
  the offline data to approximate the function or its inverse but are not sufficiently
  accurate far from the data distribution. We propose BONET, a generative framework
  for pretraining a novel model-based optimizer using offline datasets. In BONET,
  we train an autoregressive model on fixed-length trajectories derived from an offline
  dataset. We design a sampling strategy to synthesize trajectories from offline data
  using a simple heuristic of rolling out monotonic transitions from low-fidelity
  to high-fidelity samples. Empirically, we instantiate BONET using a causally masked
  Transformer (Radford et al., 2019) and evaluate it on Design-Bench (Trabucco et
  al., 2022), where we rank the best on average, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
