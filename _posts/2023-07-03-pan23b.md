title: 'Beyond Homophily: Reconstructing Structure for Graph-agnostic Clustering'
openreview: DZxkGYipRu
abstract: 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) based methods have achieved impressive performance
  on node clustering task. However, they are designed on the homophilic assumption
  of graph and clustering on heterophilic graph is overlooked. Due to the lack of
  labels, it is impossible to first identify a graph as homophilic or heterophilic
  before a suitable GNN model can be found. Hence, clustering on real-world graph
  with various levels of homophily poses a new challenge to the graph research community.
  To fill this gap, we propose a novel graph clustering method, which contains three
  key components: graph reconstruction, a mixed filter, and dual graph clustering
  network. To be graph-agnostic, we empirically construct two graphs which are high
  homophily and heterophily from each data. The mixed filter based on the new graphs
  extracts both low-frequency and high-frequency information. To reduce the adverse
  coupling between node attribute and topological structure, we separately map them
  into two subspaces in dual graph clustering network. Extensive experiments on 11
  benchmark graphs demonstrate our promising performance. In particular, our method
  dominates others on heterophilic graphs.'
