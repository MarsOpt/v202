title: 'Pythia: A Suite for Analyzing Large Language Models Across Training and Scaling'
openreview: bpRTAnJ8LW
abstract: How do large language models (LLMs) develop and evolve over the course of
  training? How do these patterns change as models scale? To answer these questions,
  we introduce <em>Pythia</em>, a suite of 16 LLMs all trained on public data seen
  in the exact same order and ranging in size from 70M to 12B parameters. We provide
  public access to 154 checkpoints for each one of the 16 models, alongside tools
  to download and reconstruct their exact training dataloaders for further study.
  We intend <em>Pythia</em> to facilitate research in many areas, and we present several
  case studies including novel results in memorization, term frequency effects on
  few-shot performance, and reducing gender bias. We demonstrate that this highly
  controlled setup can be used to yield novel insights toward LLMs and their training
  dynamics. Trained models, analysis code, training code, and training data can be
  found at https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia.
