title: 'Universal Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Symbolic Differential Operator
  Discovery with Sparse Data'
openreview: FREvWGzoRu
abstract: In this work we perform symbolic discovery of differential operators in
  a situation where there is sparse experimental data. This small data regime in machine
  learning can be made tractable by providing our algorithms with prior information
  about the underlying dynamics. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been
  very successful in this regime (reconstructing entire ODE solutions using only a
  single point or entire PDE solutions with very few measurements of the initial condition).
  The Universal PINN approach (UPINN) adds a neural network that learns a representation
  of unknown hidden terms in the differential equation. The algorithm yields both
  a surrogate solution to the differential equation and a black-box representation
  of the hidden terms. These hidden term neural networks can then be converted into
  symbolic equations using symbolic regression techniques like AI Feynman. In order
  to achieve convergence of the neural networks, we provide our algorithms with (noisy)
  measurements of both the initial condition as well as (synthetic) experimental data
  obtained at later times. We demonstrate strong performance of UPINNs even when provided
  with very few measurements of noisy data in both the ODE and PDE regime.
