title: Learning to Optimize Differentiable Games
openreview: cfUDirIjOd
abstract: Many machine learning problems can be abstracted in solving game theory
  formulations and boil down to optimizing nested objectives, such as generative adversarial
  networks (GANs) and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Solving these games requires
  finding their stable fixed points or Nash equilibrium. However, existing algorithms
  for solving games suffer from empirical instability, hence demanding heavy ad-hoc
  tuning in practice. To tackle these challenges, we resort to the emerging scheme
  of Learning to Optimize (L2O), which discovers problem-specific efficient optimization
  algorithms through data-driven training. Our customized L2O framework for differentiable
  game theory problems, dubbed â€œLearning to Play Games" (L2PG), seeks a stable fixed
  point solution, by predicting the fast update direction from the past trajectory,
  with a novel gradient stability-aware, sign-based loss function. We further incorporate
  curriculum learning and self-learning to strengthen the empirical training stability
  and generalization of L2PG. On test problems including quadratic games and GANs,
  L2PG can substantially accelerate the convergence, and demonstrates a remarkably
  more stable trajectory. Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/L2PG.
