title: Reinforcement Learning from Passive Data via Latent Intentions
openreview: Ovu1horBiZ
abstract: 'Passive observational data, such as human videos, is abundant and rich
  in information, yet remains largely untapped by current RL methods. Perhaps surprisingly,
  we show that passive data, despite not having reward or action labels, can still
  be used to learn features that accelerate downstream RL. Our approach learns from
  passive data by modeling intentions: measuring how the likelihood of future outcomes
  change when the agent acts to achieve a particular task. We propose a temporal difference
  learning objective to learn about intentions, resulting in an algorithm similar
  to conventional RL, but which learns entirely from passive data. When optimizing
  this objective, our agent simultaneously learns representations of states, of policies,
  and of possible outcomes in an environment, all from raw observational data. Both
  theoretically and empirically, this scheme learns features amenable for value prediction
  for downstream tasks, and our experiments demonstrate the ability to learn from
  many forms of passive data, including cross-embodiment video data and YouTube videos.'
