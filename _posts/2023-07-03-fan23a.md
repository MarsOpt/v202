title: Free-Form Variational Inference for Gaussian Process State-Space Models
openreview: o3cxCfmovG
abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) provide a principled and flexible
  approach to modeling the dynamics of a latent state, which is observed at discrete-time
  points via a likelihood model. However, inference in GPSSMs is computationally and
  statistically challenging due to the large number of latent variables in the model
  and the strong temporal dependencies between them. In this paper, we propose a new
  method for inference in Bayesian GPSSMs, which overcomes the drawbacks of previous
  approaches, namely over-simplified assumptions, and high computational requirements.
  Our method is based on free-form variational inference via stochastic gradient Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo within the inducing-variable formalism. Furthermore, by exploiting our
  proposed variational distribution, we provide a collapsed extension of our method
  where the inducing variables are marginalized analytically. We also showcase results
  when combining our framework with particle MCMC methods. We show that, on six real-world
  datasets, our approach can learn transition dynamics and latent states more accurately
  than competing methods.
