title: Target-Aware Generative Augmentations for Single-Shot Adaptation
openreview: K26zQKvXiR
abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of adapting models from a source domain
  to a target domain, a task that has become increasingly important due to the brittle
  generalization of deep neural networks. While several test-time adaptation techniques
  have emerged, they typically rely on synthetic toolbox data augmentations in cases
  of limited target data availability. We consider the challenging setting of single-shot
  adaptation and explore the design of augmentation strategies. We argue that augmentations
  utilized by existing methods are insufficient to handle large distribution shifts,
  and hence propose a new approach SiSTA, which first fine-tunes a generative model
  from the source domain using a single-shot target, and then employs novel sampling
  strategies for curating synthetic target data. Using experiments on a variety of
  benchmarks, distribution shifts and image corruptions, we find that SiSTA produces
  significantly improved generalization over existing baselines in face attribute
  detection and multi-class object recognition. Furthermore, SiSTA performs competitively
  to models obtained by training on larger target datasets. Our codes can be accessed
