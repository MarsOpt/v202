title: On Penalty-based Bilevel Gradient Descent Method
openreview: b79OvQq0Cs
abstract: Bilevel optimization enjoys a wide range of applications in hyper-parameter
  optimization, meta-learning and reinforcement learning. However, bilevel problems
  are difficult to solve and recent progress on scalable bilevel algorithms mainly
  focuses on bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level objective is either
  strongly convex or unconstrained. In this work, we tackle the bilevel problem through
  the lens of the penalty method. We show that under certain conditions, the penalty
  reformulation recovers the solutions of the original bilevel problem. Further, we
  propose the penalty-based bilevel gradient descent algorithm and establish its finite-time
  convergence for the constrained bilevel problem without lower-level strong convexity.
  The experimental results showcase the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
