title: Hierarchical Programmatic Reinforcement Learning via Learning to Compose Programs
openreview: NRs7BoyCcM
abstract: Aiming to produce reinforcement learning (RL) policies that are human-interpretable
  and can generalize better to novel scenarios, Trivedi et al. (2021) present a method
  (LEAPS) that first learns a program embedding space to continuously parameterize
  diverse programs from a pre-generated program dataset, and then searches for a task-solving
  program in the learned program embedding space when given a task. Despite the encouraging
  results, the program policies that LEAPS can produce are limited by the distribution
  of the program dataset. Furthermore, during searching, LEAPS evaluates each candidate
  program solely based on its return, failing to precisely reward correct parts of
  programs and penalize incorrect parts. To address these issues, we propose to learn
  a meta-policy that composes a series of programs sampled from the learned program
  embedding space. By learning to compose programs, our proposed hierarchical programmatic
  reinforcement learning (HPRL) framework can produce program policies that describe
  out-of-distributionally complex behaviors and directly assign credits to programs
  that induce desired behaviors. The experimental results in the Karel domain show
  that our proposed framework outperforms baselines. The ablation studies confirm
  the limitations of LEAPS and justify our design choices.
