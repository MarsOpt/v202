title: Truncating Trajectories in Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning
openreview: GDVczeyqFa
abstract: 'In Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent acts in an unknown environment
  to maximize the expected cumulative discounted sum of an external reward signal,
  i.e., the expected return. In practice, in many tasks of interest, such as policy
  optimization, the agent usually spends its interaction budget by collecting episodes
  of <em>fixed length</em> within a simulator (i.e., Monte Carlo simulation). However,
  given the discounted nature of the RL objective, this data collection strategy might
  not be the best option. Indeed, the rewards taken in early simulation steps weigh
  exponentially more than future rewards. Taking a cue from this intuition, in this
  paper, we design an a-priori budget allocation strategy that leads to the collection
  of trajectories of different lengths, i.e., <em>truncated</em>. The proposed approach
  provably minimizes the width of the confidence intervals around the empirical estimates
  of the expected return of a policy. After discussing the theoretical properties
  of our method, we make use of our trajectory truncation mechanism to extend Policy
  Optimization via Importance Sampling (POIS, Metelli et al., 2018) algorithm. Finally,
  we conduct a numerical comparison between our algorithm and POIS: the results are
  consistent with our theory and show that an appropriate truncation of the trajectories
  can succeed in improving performance.'
