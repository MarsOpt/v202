title: Robustly Learning a Single Neuron via Sharpness
openreview: cjWHQpEqaZ
abstract: We study the problem of learning a single neuron with respect to the $L_2^2$-loss
  in the presence of adversarial label noise. We give an efficient algorithm that,
  for a broad family of activations including ReLUs, approximates the optimal $L_2^2$-error
  within a constant factor. Notably, our algorithm succeeds under much milder distributional
  assumptions compared to prior work. The key ingredient enabling our results is a
  novel connection to local error bounds from optimization theory.
