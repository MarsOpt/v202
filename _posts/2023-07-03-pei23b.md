title: Dynamics-inspired Neuromorphic Visual Representation Learning
openreview: pRQOVucM8e
abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics-inspired neuromorphic architecture
  for visual representation learning following Hamiltonâ€™s principle. Our method converts
  weight-based neural structure to its dynamics-based form that consists of finite
  sub-models, whose mutual relations measured by computing path integrals amongst
  their dynamical states are equivalent to the typical neural weights. Based on the
  entropy reduction process derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations, the feedback
  signals interpreted as stress forces amongst sub-models push them to move. We first
  train a dynamics-based neural model from scratch and observe that this model outperforms
  traditional neural models on MNIST. We then convert several pre-trained neural structures
  into dynamics-based forms, followed by fine-tuning via entropy reduction to obtain
  the stabilized dynamical states. We observe consistent improvements in these transformed
  models over their weight-based counterparts on ImageNet and WebVision in terms of
  computational complexity, parameter size, testing accuracy, and robustness. Besides,
  we show the correlation between model performance and structural entropy, providing
  deeper insight into weight-free neuromorphic learning.
