title: On the Interplay Between Misspecification and Sub-optimality Gap in Linear
  Contextual Bandits
openreview: tNRyU4Plfl
abstract: 'We study linear contextual bandits in the misspecified setting, where the
  expected reward function can be approximated by a linear function class up to a
  bounded misspecification level $\zeta>0$. We propose an algorithm based on a novel
  data selection scheme, which only selects the contextual vectors with large uncertainty
  for online regression. We show that, when the misspecification level $\zeta$ is
  dominated by $\tilde O(\Delta / \sqrt{d})$ with $\Delta$ being the minimal sub-optimality
  gap and $d$ being the dimension of the contextual vectors, our algorithm enjoys
  the same gap-dependent regret bound $\tilde O ({d^2} /{\Delta})$ as in the well-specified
  setting up to logarithmic factors. Given this result, we show that the existing
  SupLinUCB algorithm (Chu et al., 2011) can also achieve a gap-dependent constant
  regret bound without the knowledge of sub-optimality gap $\Delta$. Together with
  a lower bound adapted from Lattimore et al. (2020), our result suggests an interplay
  between the misspecification level and the sub-optimality gap: (1) the linear contextual
  bandit model is efficiently learnable when $\zeta \leq \tilde O({\Delta} / \sqrt{d})$;
  and (2) it is not efficiently learnable when $\zeta \geq \tilde \Omega({\Delta}
  / {\sqrt{d}})$. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate
  our theoretical results.'
