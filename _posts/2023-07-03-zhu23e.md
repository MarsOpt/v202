title: Decentralized SGD and Average-direction SAM are Asymptotically Equivalent
openreview: JfzfNIM8jQ
abstract: 'Decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) allows collaborative
  learning on massive devices simultaneously without the control of a central server.
  However, existing theories claim that decentralization invariably undermines generalization.
  In this paper, we challenge the conventional belief and present a completely new
  perspective for understanding decentralized learning. We prove that D-SGD implicitly
  minimizes the loss function of an average-direction Sharpness-aware minimization
  (SAM) algorithm under general non-convex non-$\beta$-smooth settings. This surprising
  asymptotic equivalence reveals an intrinsic regularization-optimization trade-off
  and three advantages of decentralization: (1) there exists a free uncertainty evaluation
  mechanism in D-SGD to improve posterior estimation; (2) D-SGD exhibits a gradient
  smoothing effect; and (3) the sharpness regularization effect of D-SGD does not
  decrease as total batch size increases, which justifies the potential generalization
  benefit of D-SGD over centralized SGD (C-SGD) in large-batch scenarios.'
