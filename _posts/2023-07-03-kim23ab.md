title: Fair and Robust Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects for Policy Learning
openreview: 4q01bZUkcy
abstract: We propose a simple and general framework for nonparametric estimation of
  heterogeneous treatment effects under fairness constraints. Under standard regularity
  conditions, we show that the resulting estimators possess the double robustness
  property. We use this framework to characterize the trade-off between fairness and
  the maximum welfare achievable by the optimal policy. We evaluate the methods in
  a simulation study and illustrate them in a real-world case study.
