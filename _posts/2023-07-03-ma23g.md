title: Buying Information for Stochastic Optimization
openreview: DyCRGRlmNc
abstract: Stochastic optimization is one of the central problems in Machine Learning
  and Theoretical Computer Science. In the standard model, the algorithm is given
  a fixed distribution known in advance. In practice though, one may acquire at a
  cost extra information to make better decisions. In this paper, we study how to
  buy information for stochastic optimization and formulate this question as an online
  learning problem. Assuming the learner has an oracle for the original optimization
  problem, we design a $2$-competitive deterministic algorithm and a $e/(e-1)$-competitive
  randomized algorithm for buying information. We show that this ratio is tight as
  the problem is equivalent to a robust generalization of the ski-rental problem,
  which we call super-martingale stopping. We also consider an adaptive setting where
  the learner can choose to buy information after taking some actions for the underlying
  optimization problem. We focus on the classic optimization problem, Min-Sum Set
  Cover, where the goal is to quickly find an action that covers a given request drawn
  from a known distribution. We provide an $8$-competitive algorithm running in polynomial
  time that chooses actions and decides when to buy information about the underlying
  request.
