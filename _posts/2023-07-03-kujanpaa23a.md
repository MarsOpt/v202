title: Hierarchical Imitation Learning with Vector Quantized Models
openreview: S7WZP9PvqX
abstract: The ability to plan actions on multiple levels of abstraction enables intelligent
  agents to solve complex tasks effectively. However, learning the models for both
  low and high-level planning from demonstrations has proven challenging, especially
  with higher-dimensional inputs. To address this issue, we propose to use reinforcement
  learning to identify subgoals in expert trajectories by associating the magnitude
  of the rewards with the predictability of low-level actions given the state and
  the chosen subgoal. We build a vector-quantized generative model for the identified
  subgoals to perform subgoal-level planning. In experiments, the algorithm excels
  at solving complex, long-horizon decision-making problems outperforming state-of-the-art.
  Because of its ability to plan, our algorithm can find better trajectories than
  the ones in the training set.
