title: Domain Adaptation for Time Series Under Feature and Label Shifts
openreview: Xzfur8Blaf
abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables the transfer of models trained
  on source domains to unlabeled target domains. However, transferring complex time
  series models presents challenges due to the dynamic temporal structure variations
  across domains. This leads to feature shifts in the time and frequency representations.
  Additionally, the label distributions of tasks in the source and target domains
  can differ significantly, posing difficulties in addressing label shifts and recognizing
  labels unique to the target domain. Effectively transferring complex time series
  models remains a formidable problem. We present RAINCOAT, the first model for both
  closed-set and universal domain adaptation on complex time series. RAINCOAT addresses
  feature and label shifts by considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning
  them across domains, and correcting for misalignments to facilitate the detection
  of private labels. Additionally, RAINCOAT improves transferability by identifying
  label shifts in target domains. Our experiments with 5 datasets and 13 state-of-the-art
  UDA methods demonstrate that RAINCOAT can improve transfer learning performance
  by up to 16.33% and can handle both closed-set and universal domain adaptation.
