title: 'Which is Better for Learning with Noisy Labels: The Semi-supervised Method
  or Modeling Label Noise?'
openreview: HLERf0mkEF
abstract: 'In real life, accurately annotating large-scale datasets is sometimes difficult.
  Datasets used for training deep learning models are likely to contain label noise.
  To make use of the dataset containing label noise, two typical methods have been
  proposed. One is to employ the semi-supervised method by exploiting labeled <em>confident
  examples</em> and unlabeled <em>unconfident examples</em>. The other one is to <em>model
  label noise</em> and design <em>statistically consistent</em> classifiers. A natural
  question remains unsolved: which one should be used for a specific real-world application?
  In this paper, we answer the question from the perspective of <em>causal data generative
  process</em>. Specifically, the performance of the semi-supervised based method
  depends heavily on the data generative process while the method modeling label-noise
  is not influenced by the generation process. For example, for a given dataset, if
  it has a causal generative structure that the features cause the label, the semi-supervised
  based method would not be helpful. When the causal structure is unknown, we provide
  an intuitive method to discover the causal structure for a given dataset containing
  label noise.'
