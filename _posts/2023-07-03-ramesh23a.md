title: A Picture of the Space of Typical Learnable Tasks
openreview: XMH3N8rteD
abstract: 'We develop information geometric techniques to understand the representations
  learned by deep networks when they are trained on different tasks using supervised,
  meta-, semi-supervised and contrastive learning. We shed light on the following
  phenomena that relate to the structure of the space of tasks: (1) the manifold of
  probabilistic models trained on different tasks using different representation learning
  methods is effectively low-dimensional; (2) supervised learning on one task results
  in a surprising amount of progress even on seemingly dissimilar tasks; progress
  on other tasks is larger if the training task has diverse classes; (3) the structure
  of the space of tasks indicated by our analysis is consistent with parts of the
  Wordnet phylogenetic tree; (4) episodic meta-learning algorithms and supervised
  learning traverse different trajectories during training but they fit similar models
  eventually; (5) contrastive and semi-supervised learning methods traverse trajectories
  similar to those of supervised learning. We use classification tasks constructed
  from the CIFAR-10 and Imagenet datasets to study these phenomena. Code is available
  at https://github.com/grasp-lyrl/picture_of_space_of_tasks.'
