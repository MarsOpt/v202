title: Probabilistic Contrastive Learning Recovers the Correct Aleatoric Uncertainty
  of Ambiguous Inputs
openreview: 8p8GLwqL1f
abstract: 'Contrastively trained encoders have recently been proven to invert the
  data-generating process: they encode each input, e.g., an image, into the true latent
  vector that generated the image (Zimmermann et al., 2021). However, real-world observations
  often have inherent ambiguities. For instance, images may be blurred or only show
  a 2D view of a 3D object, so multiple latents could have generated them. This makes
  the true posterior for the latent vector probabilistic with heteroscedastic uncertainty.
  In this setup, we extend the common InfoNCE objective and encoders to predict latent
  distributions instead of points. We prove that these distributions recover the correct
  posteriors of the data-generating process, including its level of aleatoric uncertainty,
  up to a rotation of the latent space. In addition to providing calibrated uncertainty
  estimates, these posteriors allow the computation of credible intervals in image
  retrieval. They comprise images with the same latent as a given query, subject to
  its uncertainty. Code is at https://github.com/mkirchhof/Probabilistic_Contrastive_Learning
