title: Efficiently predicting high resolution mass spectra with graph neural networks
openreview: 81RIPI742h
abstract: 'Identifying a small molecule from its mass spectrum is the primary open
  problem in computational metabolomics. This is typically cast as information retrieval:
  an unknown spectrum is matched against spectra predicted computationally from a
  large database of chemical structures. However, current approaches to spectrum prediction
  model the output space in ways that force a tradeoff between capturing high resolution
  mass information and tractable learning. We resolve this tradeoff by casting spectrum
  prediction as a mapping from an input molecular graph to a probability distribution
  over chemical formulas. We further discover that a large corpus of mass spectra
  can be closely approximated using a fixed vocabulary constituting only 2% of all
  observed formulas. This enables efficient spectrum prediction using an architecture
  similar to graph classification - GrAFF-MS - achieving significantly lower prediction
  error and greater retrieval accuracy than previous approaches.'
