title: 'ConCerNet: A Contrastive Learning Based Framework for Automated Conservation
  Law Discovery and Trustworthy Dynamical System Prediction'
openreview: 6LJvlAiD9z
abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown great capacity of modeling a dynamical
  system; nevertheless, they usually do not obey physics constraints such as conservation
  laws. This paper proposes a new learning framework named $\textbf{ConCerNet}$ to
  improve the trustworthiness of the DNN based dynamics modeling to endow the invariant
  properties. $\textbf{ConCerNet}$ consists of two steps: (i) a contrastive learning
  method to automatically capture the system invariants (i.e. conservation properties)
  along the trajectory observations; (ii) a neural projection layer to guarantee that
  the learned dynamics models preserve the learned invariants. We theoretically prove
  the functional relationship between the learned latent representation and the unknown
  system invariant function. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms
  the baseline neural networks in both coordinate error and conservation metrics by
  a large margin. With neural network based parameterization and no dependence on
  prior knowledge, our method can be extended to complex and large-scale dynamics
  by leveraging an autoencoder.'
