title: 'No One Idles: Efficient Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Parallel Edge
  and Server Computation'
openreview: AMuNQEUmGr
abstract: 'Federated learning suffers from a latency bottleneck induced by network
  stragglers, which hampers the training efficiency significantly. In addition, due
  to the heterogeneous data distribution and security requirements, simple and fast
  averaging aggregation is not feasible anymore. Instead, complicated aggregation
  operations, such as knowledge distillation, are required. The time cost for complicated
  aggregation becomes a new bottleneck that limits the computational efficiency of
  FL. In this work, we claim that the root cause of training latency actually lies
  in the aggregation-then-broadcasting workflow of the server. By swapping the computational
  order of aggregation and broadcasting, we propose a novel and efficient parallel
  federated learning (PFL) framework that unlocks the edge nodes during global computation
  and the central server during local computation. This fully asynchronous and parallel
  pipeline enables handling complex aggregation and network stragglers, allowing flexible
  device participation as well as achieving scalability in computation. We theoretically
  prove that synchronous and asynchronous PFL can achieve a similar convergence rate
  as vanilla FL. Extensive experiments empirically show that our framework brings
  up to $5.56\times$ speedup compared with traditional FL. Code is available at: https://github.com/Hypervoyager/PFL.'
