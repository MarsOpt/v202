title: Learning the Dynamics of Sparsely Observed Interacting Systems
openreview: 5hoUVyc6MU
abstract: We address the problem of learning the dynamics of an unknown non-parametric
  system linking a target and a feature time series. The feature time series is measured
  on a sparse and irregular grid, while we have access to only a few points of the
  target time series. Once learned, we can use these dynamics to predict values of
  the target from the previous values of the feature time series. We frame this task
  as learning the solution map of a controlled differential equation (CDE). By leveraging
  the rich theory of signatures, we are able to cast this non-linear problem as a
  high-dimensional linear regression. We provide an oracle bound on the prediction
  error which exhibits explicit dependencies on the individual-specific sampling schemes.
  Our theoretical results are illustrated by simulations which show that our method
  outperforms existing algorithms for recovering the full time series while being
  computationally cheap. We conclude by demonstrating its potential on real-world
  epidemiological data.
