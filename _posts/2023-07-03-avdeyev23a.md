title: Dirichlet Diffusion Score Model for Biological Sequence Generation
openreview: O3jUIakvK7
abstract: Designing biological sequences is an important challenge that requires satisfying
  complex constraints and thus is a natural problem to address with deep generative
  modeling. Diffusion generative models have achieved considerable success in many
  applications. Score-based generative stochastic differential equations (SDE) model
  is a continuous-time diffusion model framework that enjoys many benefits, but the
  originally proposed SDEs are not naturally designed for modeling discrete data.
  To develop generative SDE models for discrete data such as biological sequences,
  here we introduce a diffusion process defined in the probability simplex space with
  stationary distribution being the Dirichlet distribution. This makes diffusion in
  continuous space natural for modeling discrete data. We refer to this approach as
  Dirchlet diffusion score model. We demonstrate that this technique can generate
  samples that satisfy hard constraints using a Sudoku generation task. This generative
  model can also solve Sudoku, including hard puzzles, without additional training.
  Finally, we applied this approach to develop the first human promoter DNA sequence
  design model and showed that designed sequences share similar properties with natural
  promoter sequences.
