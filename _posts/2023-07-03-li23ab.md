title: Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Quantum Optimal Control
openreview: iwAFqACYp8
abstract: In this paper, we present efficient quantum algorithms that are exponentially
  faster than classical algorithms for solving the quantum optimal control problem.
  This problem involves finding the control variable that maximizes a physical quantity
  at time $T$, where the system is governed by a time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
  This type of control problem also has an intricate relation with machine learning.
  Our algorithms are based on a time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation method and a
  fast gradient-estimation algorithm. We also provide a comprehensive error analysis
  to quantify the total error from various steps, such as the finite-dimensional representation
  of the control function, the discretization of the Schrödinger equation, the numerical
  quadrature, and optimization. Our quantum algorithms require fault-tolerant quantum
  computers.
