title: User-level Private Stochastic Convex Optimization with Optimal Rates
openreview: 4UStsbnfVT
abstract: We study the problem of differentially private (DP) stochastic convex optimization
  (SCO) under the notion of user-level differential privacy. In this problem, there
  are $n$ users, each contributing $m>1$ samples to the input dataset of the private
  SCO algorithm, and the notion of indistinguishability embedded in DP is w.r.t. replacing
  the entire local dataset of any given user. Under smoothness conditions of the loss,
  we establish the optimal rates for user-level DP-SCO in both the central and local
  models of DP. In particular, we show, roughly, that the optimal rate is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{nm}}+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\varepsilon
  n \sqrt{m}}$ in the central setting and is $\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\varepsilon \sqrt{nm}}$
  in the local setting, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem and $\varepsilon$
  is the privacy parameter. Our algorithms combine new user-level DP mean estimation
  techniques with carefully designed first-order stochastic optimization methods.
  For the central DP setting, our optimal rate improves over the rate attained for
  the same setting in Levy et al. (2021) by $\sqrt{d}$ factor. One of the main ingredients
  that enabled such an improvement is a novel application of the generalization properties
  of DP in the context of multi-pass stochastic gradient methods.
