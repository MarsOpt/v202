title: Beyond Uniform Lipschitz Condition in Differentially Private Optimization
openreview: 3QIUvovsgJ
abstract: Most prior results on differentially private stochastic gradient descent
  (DP-SGD) are derived under the simplistic assumption of uniform Lipschitzness, i.e.,
  the per-sample gradients are uniformly bounded. We generalize uniform Lipschitzness
  by assuming that the per-sample gradients have sample-dependent upper bounds, i.e.,
  per-sample Lipschitz constants, which themselves may be unbounded. We provide principled
  guidance on choosing the clip norm in DP-SGD for convex over-parameterized settings
  satisfying our general version of Lipschitzness when the per-sample Lipschitz constants
  are bounded; specifically, we recommend tuning the clip norm only till values up
  to the minimum per-sample Lipschitz constant. This finds application in the private
  training of a softmax layer on top of a deep network pre-trained on public data.
  We verify the efficacy of our recommendation via experiments on 8 datasets. Furthermore,
  we provide new convergence results for DP-SGD on convex and nonconvex functions
  when the Lipschitz constants are unbounded but have bounded moments, i.e., they
  are heavy-tailed.
