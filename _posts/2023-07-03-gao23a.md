title: Solving Linear Programs with Fast Online Learning Algorithms
openreview: AM1UcqDDDv
abstract: This paper presents fast first-order methods for solving linear programs
  (LPs) approximately. We adapt online linear programming algorithms to offline LPs
  and obtain algorithms that avoid any matrix multiplication. We also introduce a
  variable-duplication technique that copies each variable $K$ times and reduces the
  optimality gap and constraint violation by a factor of $\sqrt{K}$. Furthermore,
  we show how online algorithms can be effectively integrated into sifting, a column
  generation scheme for large-scale LPs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our
  methods can serve as either an approximate direct solver, or an initialization subroutine
  for exact LP solving.
