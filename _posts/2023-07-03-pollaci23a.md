title: Spurious Valleys and Clustering Behavior of Neural Networks
openreview: TuHgrnPHZq
abstract: Neural networks constitute a class of functions that are typically non-surjective,
  with high-dimensional fibers and complicated image. We prove two main results concerning
  the geometry of the loss landscape of a neural network. First, we provide an explicit
  effective bound on the sizes of the hidden layers so that the loss landscape has
  no spurious valleys, which guarantees the success of gradient descent methods. Second,
  we present a novel method for analyzing whether a given neural network architecture
  with monomial activation function can represent a target function of interest. The
  core of our analysis method is the study of a specific set of error values, and
  its behavior depending on different training datasets.
