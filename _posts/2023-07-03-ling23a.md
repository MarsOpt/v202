title: Graph Mixup with Soft Alignments
openreview: zS6QCVwPUs
abstract: We study graph data augmentation by mixup, which has been used successfully
  on images. A key operation of mixup is to compute a convex combination of a pair
  of inputs. This operation is straightforward for grid-like data, such as images,
  but challenging for graph data. The key difficulty lies in the fact that different
  graphs typically have different numbers of nodes, and thus there lacks a node-level
  correspondence between graphs. In this work, we propose S-Mixup, a simple yet effective
  mixup method for graph classification by soft alignments. Specifically, given a
  pair of graphs, we explicitly obtain node-level correspondence via computing a soft
  assignment matrix to match the nodes between two graphs. Based on the soft assignments,
  we transform the adjacency and node feature matrices of one graph, so that the transformed
  graph is aligned with the other graph. In this way, any pair of graphs can be mixed
  directly to generate an augmented graph. We conduct systematic experiments to show
  that S-Mixup can improve the performance and generalization of graph neural networks
  (GNNs) on various graph classification tasks. In addition, we show that S-Mixup
  can increase the robustness of GNNs against noisy labels. Our code is publicly available
  as part of the DIG package (https://github.com/divelab/DIG).
