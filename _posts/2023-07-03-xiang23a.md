title: 'UMD: Unsupervised Model Detection for X2X Backdoor Attacks'
openreview: t0ozPUGnBs
abstract: Backdoor (Trojan) attack is a common threat to deep neural networks, where
  samples from one or more source classes embedded with a backdoor trigger will be
  misclassified to adversarial target classes. Existing methods for detecting whether
  a classifier is backdoor attacked are mostly designed for attacks with a single
  adversarial target (e.g., all-to-one attack). To the best of our knowledge, without
  supervision, no existing methods can effectively address the more general X2X attack
  with an arbitrary number of source classes, each paired with an arbitrary target
  class. In this paper, we propose UMD, the first Unsupervised Model Detection method
  that effectively detects X2X backdoor attacks via a joint inference of the adversarial
  (source, target) class pairs. In particular, we first define a novel transferability
  statistic to measure and select a subset of putative backdoor class pairs based
  on a proposed clustering approach. Then, these selected class pairs are jointly
  assessed based on an aggregation of their reverse-engineered trigger size for detection
  inference, using a robust and unsupervised anomaly detector we proposed. We conduct
  comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and Imagenette dataset, and show that
  our unsupervised UMD outperforms SOTA detectors (even with supervision) by 17%,
  4%, and 8%, respectively, in terms of the detection accuracy against diverse X2X
  attacks. We also show the strong detection performance of UMD against several strong
  adaptive attacks.
