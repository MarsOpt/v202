title: 'Contextual Reliability: When Different Features Matter in Different Contexts'
openreview: s1hrcLUcld
abstract: Deep neural networks often fail catastrophically by relying on spurious
  correlations. Most prior work assumes a clear dichotomy into spurious and reliable
  features; however, this is often unrealistic. For example, most of the time we do
  not want an autonomous car to simply copy the speed of surrounding cars—we don’t
  want our car to run a red light if a neighboring car does so. However, we cannot
  simply enforce invariance to next-lane speed, since it could provide valuable information
  about an unobservable pedestrian at a crosswalk. Thus, universally ignoring features
  that are sometimes (but not always) reliable can lead to non-robust performance.
  We formalize a new setting called contextual reliability which accounts for the
  fact that the "right" features to use may vary depending on the context. We propose
  and analyze a two-stage framework called Explicit Non-spurious feature Prediction
  (ENP) which first identifies the relevant features to use for a given context, then
  trains a model to rely exclusively on these features. Our work theoretically and
  empirically demonstrates the advantages of ENP over existing methods and provides
  new benchmarks for contextual reliability.
