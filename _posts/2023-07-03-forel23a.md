title: 'Explainable Data-Driven Optimization: From Context to Decision and Back Again'
openreview: 4Lk9GHHueJ
abstract: Data-driven optimization uses contextual information and machine learning
  algorithms to find solutions to decision problems with uncertain parameters. While
  a vast body of work is dedicated to interpreting machine learning models in the
  classification setting, explaining decision pipelines involving learning algorithms
  remains unaddressed. This lack of interpretability can block the adoption of data-driven
  solutions as practitioners may not understand or trust the recommended decisions.
  We bridge this gap by introducing a counterfactual explanation methodology tailored
  to explain solutions to data-driven problems. We introduce two classes of explanations
  and develop methods to find nearest explanations of random forest and nearest-neighbor
  predictors. We demonstrate our approach by explaining key problems in operations
  management such as inventory management and routing.
