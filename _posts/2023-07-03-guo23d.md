title: Provably Efficient Representation Learning with Tractable Planning in Low-Rank
  POMDP
openreview: MI5YpKX84O
abstract: In this paper, we study representation learning in partially observable
  Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), where the agent learns a decoder function that
  maps a series of high-dimensional raw observations to a compact representation and
  uses it for more efficient exploration and planning. We focus our attention on the
  sub-classes of <em>$\gamma$-observable</em> and <em>decodable POMDPs</em>, for which
  it has been shown that statistically tractable learning is possible, but there has
  not been any computationally efficient algorithm. We first present an algorithm
  for decodable PMMDPs that combines maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and optimism
  in the face of uncertainty (OFU) to perform representation learning and achieve
  efficient sample complexity, while only calling supervised learning computational
  oracles. We then show how to adapt this algorithm to also work in the broader class
  of $\gamma$-observable POMDPs.
