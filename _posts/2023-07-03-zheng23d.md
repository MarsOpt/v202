title: Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models via Operator Learning
openreview: gWC3Q3pyHe
abstract: Diffusion models have found widespread adoption in various areas. However,
  their sampling process is slow because it requires hundreds to thousands of network
  evaluations to emulate a continuous process defined by differential equations. In
  this work, we use neural operators, an efficient method to solve the probability
  flow differential equations, to accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models.
  Compared to other fast sampling methods that have a sequential nature, we are the
  first to propose a parallel decoding method that generates images with only one
  model forward pass. We propose <em>diffusion model sampling with neural operator</em>
  (DSNO) that maps the initial condition, i.e., Gaussian distribution, to the continuous-time
  solution trajectory of the reverse diffusion process. To model the temporal correlations
  along the trajectory, we introduce temporal convolution layers that are parameterized
  in the Fourier space into the given diffusion model backbone. We show our method
  achieves state-of-the-art FID of 3.78 for CIFAR-10 and 7.83 for ImageNet-64 in the
  one-model-evaluation setting.
