title: A Unifying Framework to the Analysis of Interaction Methods using Synergy Functions
openreview: BBzoAiVFG1
abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many areas of machine learning, from computer
  vision to natural language processing, but these high-performance models are generally
  â€œblack box." Explaining such models would improve transparency and trust in AI-powered
  decision making and is necessary for understanding other practical needs such as
  robustness and fairness. A popular means of enhancing model transparency is to quantify
  how individual inputs contribute to model outputs (called attributions) and the
  magnitude of interactions between groups of inputs. A growing number of these methods
  import concepts and results from game theory to produce attributions and interactions.
  This work presents a unifying framework for game-theory-inspired attribution and
  $k^\text{th}$-order interaction methods. We show that, given modest assumptions,
  a unique full account of interactions between features, called synergies, is possible
  in the continuous input setting. We identify how various methods are characterized
  by their policy of distributing synergies. We establish that gradient-based methods
  are characterized by their actions on monomials, a type of synergy function, and
  introduce unique gradient-based methods. We show that the combination of various
  criteria uniquely defines the attribution/interaction methods. Thus, the community
  needs to identify goals and contexts when developing and employing attribution and
  interaction methods.
