title: 'CircuitNet: A Generic Neural Network to Realize Universal Circuit Motif Modeling'
openreview: Fl9q5z40e3
abstract: The successes of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are largely attributed
  to mimicking the human brain structures. Recent advances in neuroscience revealed
  that neurons interact with each other through various kinds of connectivity patterns
  to process information, in which the common connectivity patterns are also called
  circuit motifs. However, many existing ANNs can only model one or two circuit motifs
  in their architectures, so that their performance may drastically vary among different
  types of machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose a new type of neural
  network inspired by the architectures of neuronal circuits, namely Circuit Neural
  Network (CircuitNet). In CircuitNet, a group of densely connected neurons, namely
  circuit motif unit (CMU), form the basic unit of the network, which is capable of
  modeling universal circuit motifs by adjusting the weights within the CMUs. Compared
  with traditional feed-forward networks, CircuitNet has the ability to model more
  types of neuron connections such as feed-back and lateral motifs. Inspired by the
  locally dense and globally sparse structure of the human brain, several iterations
  of signal transmission among different CMUs are achieved by sparse connections through
  the input ports and output ports of different CMUs. Experiments have demonstrated
  that CircuitNet can outperform popular neural network architectures in function
  approximation, reinforcement learning, image classification, and time series forecasting
  tasks.
