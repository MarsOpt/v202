title: Deep Laplacian-based Options for Temporally-Extended Exploration
openreview: zoxrImInpR
abstract: Selecting exploratory actions that generate a rich stream of experience
  for better learning is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). An
  approach to tackle this problem consists in selecting actions according to specific
  policies for an extended period of time, also known as options. A recent line of
  work to derive such exploratory options builds upon the eigenfunctions of the graph
  Laplacian. Importantly, until now these methods have been mostly limited to tabular
  domains where (1) the graph Laplacian matrix was either given or could be fully
  estimated, (2) performing eigendecomposition on this matrix was computationally
  tractable, and (3) value functions could be learned exactly. Additionally, these
  methods required a separate option discovery phase. These assumptions are fundamentally
  not scalable. In this paper we address these limitations and show how recent results
  for directly approximating the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian can be leveraged
  to truly scale up options-based exploration. To do so, we introduce a fully online
  deep RL algorithm for discovering Laplacian-based options and evaluate our approach
  on a variety of pixel-based tasks. We compare to several state-of-the-art exploration
  methods and show that our approach is effective, general, and especially promising
  in non-stationary settings.
