title: Abstract-to-Executable Trajectory Translation for One-Shot Task Generalization
openreview: SryTYOIGJx
abstract: 'Training long-horizon robotic policies in complex physical environments
  is essential for many applications, such as robotic manipulation. However, learning
  a policy that can generalize to unseen tasks is challenging. In this work, we propose
  to achieve one-shot task generalization by decoupling plan generation and plan execution.
  Specifically, our method solves complex long-horizon tasks in three steps: build
  a paired abstract environment by simplifying geometry and physics, generate abstract
  trajectories, and solve the original task by an abstract-to-executable trajectory
  translator. In the abstract environment, complex dynamics such as physical manipulation
  are removed, making abstract trajectories easier to generate. However, this introduces
  a large domain gap between abstract trajectories and the actual executed trajectories
  as abstract trajectories lack low-level details and are not aligned frame-to-frame
  with the executed trajectory. In a manner reminiscent of language translation, our
  approach leverages a seq-to-seq model to overcome the large domain gap between the
  abstract and executable trajectories, enabling the low-level policy to follow the
  abstract trajectory. Experimental results on various unseen long-horizon tasks with
  different robot embodiments demonstrate the practicability of our methods to achieve
  one-shot task generalization.'
