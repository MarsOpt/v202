title: Robust One-Class Classification with Signed Distance Function using 1-Lipschitz
  Neural Networks
openreview: g68Q7mL0P5
abstract: We propose a new method, dubbed One Class Signed Distance Function (OCSDF),
  to perform One Class Classification (OCC) by provably learning the Signed Distance
  Function (SDF) to the boundary of the support of any distribution. The distance
  to the support can be interpreted as a normality score, and its approximation using
  1-Lipschitz neural networks provides robustness bounds against $l2$ adversarial
  attacks, an under-explored weakness of deep learning-based OCC algorithms. As a
  result, OCSDF comes with a new metric, certified AUROC, that can be computed at
  the same cost as any classical AUROC. We show that OCSDF is competitive against
  concurrent methods on tabular and image data while being way more robust to adversarial
  attacks, illustrating its theoretical properties. Finally, as exploratory research
  perspectives, we theoretically and empirically show how OCSDF connects OCC with
  image generation and implicit neural surface parametrization.
