title: 'Confidence and Dispersity Speak: Characterizing Prediction Matrix for Unsupervised
  Accuracy Estimation'
openreview: VlYcGv9fwE
abstract: This work aims to assess how well a model performs under distribution shifts
  without using labels. While recent methods study prediction confidence, this work
  reports prediction dispersity is another informative cue. Confidence reflects whether
  the individual prediction is certain; dispersity indicates how the overall predictions
  are distributed across all categories. Our key insight is that a well-performing
  model should give predictions with high confidence and high dispersity. That is,
  we need to consider both properties so as to make more accurate estimates. To this
  end, we use nuclear norm that has been shown to be effective in characterizing both
  properties. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of nuclear norm for
  various models (e.g., ViT and ConvNeXt), different datasets (e.g., ImageNet and
  CUB-200), and diverse types of distribution shifts (e.g., style shift and reproduction
  shift). We show that nuclear norm is more accurate and robust in accuracy estimation
  than existing methods. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of other measurements
  (e.g., mutual information maximization) for characterizing dispersity and confidence.
  Lastly, we investigate the limitation of the nuclear norm, study its improved variant
  under severe class imbalance, and discuss potential directions.
