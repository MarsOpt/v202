title: Direct Parameterization of Lipschitz-Bounded Deep Networks
openreview: 1lqOZrdXeG
abstract: This paper introduces a new parameterization of deep neural networks (both
  fully-connected and convolutional) with guaranteed $\ell^2$ Lipschitz bounds, i.e.
  limited sensitivity to input perturbations. The Lipschitz guarantees are equivalent
  to the tightest-known bounds based on certification via a semidefinite program (SDP).
  We provide a “direct” parameterization, i.e., a smooth mapping from $\mathbb R^N$
  onto the set of weights satisfying the SDP-based bound. Moreover, our parameterization
  is complete, i.e. a neural network satisfies the SDP bound if and only if it can
  be represented via our parameterization. This enables training using standard gradient
  methods, without any inner approximation or computationally intensive tasks (e.g.
  projections or barrier terms) for the SDP constraint. The new parameterization can
  equivalently be thought of as either a new layer type (the <em>sandwich layer</em>),
  or a novel parameterization of standard feedforward networks with parameter sharing
  between neighbouring layers. A comprehensive set of experiments on image classification
  shows that sandwich layers outperform previous approaches on both empirical and
  certified robust accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/acfr/LBDN.
