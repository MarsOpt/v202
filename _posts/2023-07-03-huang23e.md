title: 'Banker Online Mirror Descent: A Universal Approach for Delayed Online Bandit
  Learning'
openreview: n2bG2TExOL
abstract: We propose Banker Online Mirror Descent (Banker-OMD), a novel framework
  generalizing the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD) technique in the online learning
  literature. The Banker-OMD framework almost completely decouples feedback delay
  handling and the task-specific OMD algorithm design, thus facilitating the design
  of new algorithms capable of efficiently and robustly handling feedback delays.
  Specifically, it offers a general methodology for achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal
  O}(\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{D})$-style regret bounds in online bandit learning tasks with
  delayed feedback, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $D$ is the total feedback
  delay. We demonstrate the power of Banker-OMD by applications to two important bandit
  learning scenarios with delayed feedback, including delayed scale-free adversarial
  Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) and delayed adversarial linear bandits. Banker-OMD leads
  to the first delayed scale-free adversarial MAB algorithm achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal
  O}(\sqrt{K}L(\sqrt T+\sqrt D))$ regret and the first delayed adversarial linear
  bandit algorithm achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\text{poly}(n)(\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{D}))$
  regret. As a corollary, the first application also implies $\widetilde{\mathcal
  O}(\sqrt{KT}L)$ regret for non-delayed scale-free adversarial MABs, which is the
  first to match the $\Omega(\sqrt{KT}L)$ lower bound up to logarithmic factors and
  can be of independent interest.
