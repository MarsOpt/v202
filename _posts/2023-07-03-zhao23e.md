title: Addressing Budget Allocation and Revenue Allocation in Data Market Environments
  Using an Adaptive Sampling Algorithm
openreview: iAgQfF3atY
abstract: 'High-quality machine learning models are dependent on access to high-quality
  training data. When the data are not already available, it is tedious and costly
  to obtain them. Data markets help with identifying valuable training data: model
  consumers pay to train a model, the market uses that budget to identify data and
  train the model (the budget allocation problem), and finally the market compensates
  data providers according to their data contribution (revenue allocation problem).
  For example, a bank could pay the data market to access data from other financial
  institutions to train a fraud detection model. Compensating data contributors requires
  understanding data’s contribution to the model; recent efforts to solve this revenue
  allocation problem based on the Shapley value are inefficient to lead to practical
  data markets. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to solve budget allocation
  and revenue allocation problems simultaneously in linear time. The new algorithm
  employs an adaptive sampling process that selects data from those providers who
  are contributing the most to the model. Better data means that the algorithm accesses
  those providers more often, and more frequent accesses corresponds to higher compensation.
  Furthermore, the algorithm can be deployed in both centralized and federated scenarios,
  boosting its applicability. We provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm
  that show the budget is used efficiently and the properties of revenue allocation
  are similar to Shapley’s. Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation to show the
  performance of the algorithm in practical scenarios and when compared to other baselines.
  Overall, we believe that the new algorithm paves the way for the implementation
  of practical data markets.'
