title: Topological Point Cloud Clustering
openreview: q2L5r7WEHT
abstract: We present Topological Point Cloud Clustering (TPCC), a new method to cluster
  points in an arbitrary point cloud based on their contribution to global topological
  features. TPCC synthesizes desirable features from spectral clustering and topological
  data analysis and is based on considering the spectral properties of a simplicial
  complex associated to the considered point cloud. As it is based on considering
  sparse eigenvector computations, TPCC is similarly easy to interpret and implement
  as spectral clustering. However, by focusing not just on a single matrix associated
  to a graph created from the point cloud data, but on a whole set of Hodge-Laplacians
  associated to an appropriately constructed simplicial complex, we can leverage a
  far richer set of topological features to characterize the data points within the
  point cloud and benefit from the relative robustness of topological techniques against
  noise. We test the performance of TPCC on both synthetic and real-world data and
  compare it with classical spectral clustering.
