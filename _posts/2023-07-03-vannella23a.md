title: Best Arm Identification in Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits
openreview: AzFq5HxVlg
abstract: We investigate the problem of best arm identification in Multi-Agent Multi-Armed
  Bandits (MAMABs) where the rewards are defined through a factor graph. The objective
  is to find an optimal global action with a prescribed level of confidence and minimal
  sample complexity. We derive a tight instance-specific lower bound of the sample
  complexity and characterize the corresponding optimal sampling strategy. Unfortunately,
  this bound is obtained by solving a combinatorial optimization problem with a number
  of variables and constraints exponentially growing with the number of agents. We
  leverage Mean Field (MF) techniques to obtain, in a computationally efficient manner,
  an approximation of the lower bound. The approximation scales at most as $\rho K^d$
  (where $\rho$, $K$, and $d$ denote the number of factors in the graph, the number
  of possible actions per agent, and the maximal degree of the factor graph). We devise
  MF-TaS (Mean-Field-Track-and-Stop), an algorithm whose sample complexity provably
  matches our approximated lower bound. We illustrate the performance of MF-TaS numerically
  using both synthetic and real-world experiments (e.g., to solve the antenna tilt
  optimization problem in radio communication networks).
