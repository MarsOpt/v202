title: FedAvg Converges to Zero Training Loss Linearly for Overparameterized Multi-Layer
  Neural Networks
openreview: eqTWOzheZT
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
  multiple clients to learn a joint model by utilizing privately held data at each
  client. Significant research efforts have been devoted to develop advanced algorithms
  that deal with the situation where the data at individual clients have heterogeneous
  distributions. In this work, we show that data heterogeneity can be dealt from a
  different perspective. That is, by utilizing a certain overparameterized multi-layer
  neural network at each client, even the vanilla FedAvg (a.k.a. the Local SGD) algorithm
  can accurately optimize the training problem: When each client has a neural network
  with one wide layer of size $N$ (where $N$ is the number of total training samples),
  followed by layers of smaller widths, FedAvg converges linearly to a solution that
  achieves (almost) zero training loss, without requiring any assumptions on the clientsâ€™
  data distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first work that demonstrates such
  resilience to data heterogeneity for FedAvg when trained on multi-layer neural networks.
  Our experiments also confirm that, neural networks of large size can achieve better
  and more stable performance for FL problems.'
