title: 'HarsanyiNet: Computing Accurate Shapley Values in a Single Forward Propagation'
openreview: p9vOr0rdbs
abstract: The Shapley value is widely regarded as a trustworthy attribution metric.
  However, when people use Shapley values to explain the attribution of input variables
  of a deep neural network (DNN), it usually requires a very high computational cost
  to approximate relatively accurate Shapley values in real-world applications. Therefore,
  we propose a novel network architecture, the HarsanyiNet, which makes inferences
  on the input sample and simultaneously computes the exact Shapley values of the
  input variables in a single forward propagation. The HarsanyiNet is designed on
  the theoretical foundation that the Shapley value can be reformulated as the redistribution
  of Harsanyi interactions encoded by the network.
