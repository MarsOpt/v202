title: Approximate Causal Effect Identification under Weak Confounding
openreview: iRBKUnIjR2
abstract: Causal effect estimation has been studied by many researchers when only
  observational data is available. Sound and complete algorithms have been developed
  for pointwise estimation of identifiable causal queries. For non-identifiable causal
  queries, researchers developed polynomial programs to estimate tight bounds on causal
  effect. However, these are computationally difficult to optimize for variables with
  large support sizes. In this paper, we analyze the effect of "weak confoundingâ€™"
  on causal estimands. More specifically, under the assumption that the unobserved
  confounders that render a query non-identifiable have small entropy, we propose
  an efficient linear program to derive the upper and lower bounds of the causal effect.
  We show that our bounds are consistent in the sense that as the entropy of unobserved
  confounders goes to zero, the gap between the upper and lower bound vanishes. Finally,
  we conduct synthetic and real data simulations to compare our bounds with the bounds
  obtained by the existing work that cannot incorporate such entropy constraints and
  show that our bounds are tighter for the setting with weak confounders.
