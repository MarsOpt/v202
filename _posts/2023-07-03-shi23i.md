title: On the Complexity of Bayesian Generalization
openreview: hhszTjRaBx
abstract: 'We examine concept generalization at a large scale in the natural visual
  spectrum. Established computational modes (<em>i.e.</em>, rule-based or similarity-based)
  are primarily studied isolated, focusing on confined and abstract problem spaces.
  In this work, we study these two modes when the <em>problem space</em> scales up
  and when the <em>complexity</em> of concepts becomes diverse. At the <b>representational
  level</b>, we investigate how the complexity varies when a visual concept is mapped
  to the representation space. Prior literature has shown that two types of complexities
  (Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2003) build an inverted-U relation (Donderi, 2006; Sun &
  Firestone, 2021). Leveraging <em>Representativeness of Attribute</em> (RoA), we
  computationally confirm: Models use attributes with high RoA to describe visual
  concepts, and the description length falls in an inverted-U relation with the increment
  in visual complexity. At the <b>computational level</b>, we examine how the complexity
  of representation affects the shift between the rule- and similarity-based generalization.
  We hypothesize that category-conditioned visual modeling estimates the co-occurrence
  frequency between visual and categorical attributes, thus potentially serving as
  the prior for the natural visual world. Experimental results show that representations
  with relatively high subjective complexity outperform those with relatively low
  subjective complexity in rule-based generalization, while the trend is the opposite
  in similarity-based generalization.'
