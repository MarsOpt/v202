title: Differentiable Simulations for Enhanced Sampling of Rare Events
openreview: 15NZ7EzZd8
abstract: Simulating rare events, such as the transformation of a reactant into a
  product in a chemical reaction typically requires enhanced sampling techniques that
  rely on heuristically chosen collective variables (CVs). We propose using differentiable
  simulations (DiffSim) for the discovery and enhanced sampling of chemical transformations
  without a need to resort to preselected CVs, using only a distance metric. Reaction
  path discovery and estimation of the biasing potential that enhances the sampling
  are merged into a single end-to-end problem that is solved by path-integral optimization.
  This is achieved by introducing multiple improvements over standard DiffSim such
  as partial backpropagation and graph mini-batching making DiffSim training stable
  and efficient. The potential of DiffSim is demonstrated in the successful discovery
  of transition paths for the Muller-Brown model potential as well as a benchmark
  chemical system - alanine dipeptide.
