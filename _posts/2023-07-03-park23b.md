title: Learning Affinity with Hyperbolic Representation for Spatial Propagation
openreview: a5BIUnE7cR
abstract: Recent approaches to representation learning have successfully demonstrated
  the benefits in hyperbolic space, driven by an excellent ability to make hierarchical
  relationships. In this work, we demonstrate that the properties of hyperbolic geometry
  serve as a valuable alternative to learning hierarchical affinity for spatial propagation
  tasks. We propose a Hyperbolic Affinity learning Module (HAM) to learn spatial affinity
  by considering geodesic distance on the hyperbolic space. By simply incorporating
  our HAM into conventional spatial propagation tasks, we validate its effectiveness,
  capturing the pixel hierarchy of affinity maps in hyperbolic space. The proposed
  methodology can lead to performance improvements in explicit propagation processes
  such as depth completion and semantic segmentation.
