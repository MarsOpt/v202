title: PAC-Bayesian Offline Contextual Bandits With Guarantees
openreview: xN7I0tRuPZ
abstract: This paper introduces a new principled approach for off-policy learning
  in contextual bandits. Unlike previous work, our approach does not derive learning
  principles from intractable or loose bounds. We analyse the problem through the
  PAC-Bayesian lens, interpreting policies as mixtures of decision rules. This allows
  us to propose novel generalization bounds and provide tractable algorithms to optimize
  them. We prove that the derived bounds are tighter than their competitors, and can
  be optimized directly to confidently improve upon the logging policy offline. Our
  approach learns policies with guarantees, uses all available data and does not require
  tuning additional hyperparameters on held-out sets. We demonstrate through extensive
  experiments the effectiveness of our approach in providing performance guarantees
  in practical scenarios.
