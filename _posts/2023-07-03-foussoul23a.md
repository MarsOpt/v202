title: Last Switch Dependent Bandits with Monotone Payoff Functions
openreview: fnCwNbOs0S
abstract: In a recent work, Laforgue et al. introduce the model of last switch dependent
  (LSD) bandits, in an attempt to capture nonstationary phenomena induced by the interaction
  between the player and the environment. Examples include satiation, where consecutive
  plays of the same action lead to decreased performance, or deprivation, where the
  payoff of an action increases after an interval of inactivity. In this work, we
  take a step towards understanding the approximability of planning LSD bandits, namely,
  the (NP-hard) problem of computing an optimal arm-pulling strategy under complete
  knowledge of the model. In particular, we design the first efficient constant approximation
  algorithm for the problem and show that, under a natural monotonicity assumption
  on the payoffs, its approximation guarantee (almost) matches the state-of-the-art
  for the special and well-studied class of recharging bandits (also known as delay-dependent).
  In this attempt, we develop new tools and insights for this class of problems, including
  a novel higher-dimensional relaxation and the technique of mirroring the evolution
  of virtual states. We believe that these novel elements could potentially be used
  for approaching richer classes of action-induced nonstationary bandits (e.g., special
  instances of restless bandits). In the case where the model parameters are initially
  unknown, we develop an online learning adaptation of our algorithm for which we
  provide sublinear regret guarantees against its full-information counterpart.
