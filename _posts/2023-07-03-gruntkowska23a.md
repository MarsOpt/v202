title: 'EF21-P and Friends: Improved Theoretical Communication Complexity for Distributed
  Optimization with Bidirectional Compression'
openreview: kdkkLwyJe1
abstract: In this work we focus our attention on distributed optimization problems
  in the context where the communication time between the server and the workers is
  non-negligible. We obtain novel methods supporting bidirectional compression (both
  from the server to the workers and vice versa) that enjoy new state-of-the-art theoretical
  communication complexity for convex and nonconvex problems. Our bounds are the first
  that manage to decouple the variance/error coming from the workers-to-server and
  server-to-workers compression, transforming a multiplicative dependence to an additive
  one. Moreover, in the convex regime, we obtain the first bounds that match the theoretical
  communication complexity of gradient descent. Even in this convex regime, our algorithms
  work with biased gradient estimators, which is non-standard and requires new proof
  techniques that may be of independent interest. Finally, our theoretical results
  are corroborated through suitable experiments.
