title: 'Towards Deep Attention in Graph Neural Networks: Problems and Remedies'
openreview: GESSdu0RIA
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn the representation of graph-structured
  data, and their expressiveness can be further enhanced by inferring node relations
  for propagation. Attention-based GNNs infer neighbor importance to manipulate the
  weight of its propagation. Despite their popularity, the discussion on deep graph
  attention and its unique challenges has been limited. In this work, we investigate
  some problematic phenomena related to deep graph attention, including vulnerability
  to over-smoothed features and smooth cumulative attention. Through theoretical and
  empirical analyses, we show that various attention-based GNNs suffer from these
  problems. Motivated by our findings, we propose AERO-GNN, a novel GNN architecture
  designed for deep graph attention. AERO-GNN provably mitigates the proposed problems
  of deep graph attention, which is further empirically demonstrated with (a) its
  adaptive and less smooth attention functions and (b) higher performance at deep
  layers (up to 64). On 9 out of 12 node classification benchmarks, AERO-GNN outperforms
  the baseline GNNs, highlighting the advantages of deep graph attention. Our code
  is available at https://github.com/syleeheal/AERO-GNN.
