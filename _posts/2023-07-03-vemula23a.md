title: 'The Virtues of Laziness in Model-based RL: A Unified Objective and Algorithms'
openreview: F6uHGKVa04
abstract: 'We propose a novel approach to addressing two fundamental challenges in
  Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL): the computational expense of repeatedly
  finding a good policy in the learned model, and the objective mismatch between model
  fitting and policy computation. Our "lazy" method leverages a novel unified objective,
  Performance Difference via Advantage in Model, to capture the performance difference
  between the learned policy and expert policy under the true dynamics. This objective
  demonstrates that optimizing the expected policy advantage in the learned model
  under an exploration distribution is sufficient for policy computation, resulting
  in a significant boost in computational efficiency compared to traditional planning
  methods. Additionally, the unified objective uses a value moment matching term for
  model fitting, which is aligned with the modelâ€™s usage during policy computation.
  We present two no-regret algorithms to optimize the proposed objective, and demonstrate
  their statistical and computational gains compared to existing MBRL methods through
  simulated benchmarks.'
