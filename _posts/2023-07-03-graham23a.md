title: Formalizing Preferences Over Runtime Distributions
openreview: HWhaVJA2eb
abstract: When trying to solve a computational problem, we are often faced with a
  choice between algorithms that are guaranteed to return the right answer but differ
  in their runtime distributions (e.g., SAT solvers, sorting algorithms). This paper
  aims to lay theoretical foundations for such choices by formalizing preferences
  over runtime distributions. It might seem that we should simply prefer the algorithm
  that minimizes expected runtime. However, such preferences would be driven by exactly
  how slow our algorithm is on bad inputs, whereas in practice we are typically willing
  to cut off occasional, sufficiently long runs before they finish. We propose a principled
  alternative, taking a utility-theoretic approach to characterize the scoring functions
  that describe preferences over algorithms. These functions depend on the way our
  value for solving our problem decreases with time and on the distribution from which
  captimes are drawn. We describe examples of realistic utility functions and show
  how to leverage a maximum-entropy approach for modeling underspecified captime distributions.
  Finally, we show how to efficiently estimate an algorithmâ€™s expected utility from
  runtime samples.
