title: Bootstrap in High Dimension with Low Computation
openreview: RIf7TPG5H0
abstract: The bootstrap is a popular data-driven method to quantify statistical uncertainty,
  but for modern high-dimensional problems, it could suffer from huge computational
  costs due to the need to repeatedly generate resamples and refit models. We study
  the use of bootstraps in high-dimensional environments with a small number of resamples.
  In particular, we show that with a recent "cheap" bootstrap perspective, using a
  number of resamples as small as one could attain valid coverage even when the dimension
  grows closely with the sample size, thus strongly supporting the implementability
  of the bootstrap for large-scale problems. We validate our theoretical results and
  compare the performance of our approach with other benchmarks via a range of experiments.
