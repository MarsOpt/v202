title: Learning Control-Oriented Dynamical Structure from Data
openreview: oke1MUPK2l
abstract: Even for known nonlinear dynamical systems, feedback controller synthesis
  is a difficult problem that often requires leveraging the particular structure of
  the dynamics to induce a stable closed-loop system. For general nonlinear models,
  including those fit to data, there may not be enough known structure to reliably
  synthesize a stabilizing feedback controller. In this paper, we discuss a state-dependent
  nonlinear tracking controller formulation based on a state-dependent Riccati equation
  for general nonlinear control-affine systems. This formulation depends on a nonlinear
  factorization of the system of vector fields defining the control-affine dynamics,
  which always exists under mild smoothness assumptions. We propose a method for learning
  this factorization from a finite set of data. On a variety of simulated nonlinear
  dynamical systems, we empirically demonstrate the efficacy of learned versions of
  this controller in stable trajectory tracking. Alongside our learning method, we
  evaluate recent ideas in jointly learning a controller and stabilizability certificate
  for known dynamical systems; we show experimentally that such methods can be frail
  in comparison.
