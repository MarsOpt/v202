title: Consistency of Multiple Kernel Clustering
openreview: wV2CUxaaSv
abstract: Consistency plays an important role in learning theory. However, in multiple
  kernel clustering (MKC), the consistency of kernel weights has not been sufficiently
  investigated. In this work, we fill this gap with a non-asymptotic analysis on the
  consistency of kernel weights of a novel method termed SimpleMKKM. Under the assumptions
  of the eigenvalue gap, we give an infinity norm bound as $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k/\sqrt{n})$,
  where $k$ is the number of clusters and $n$ is the number of samples. On this basis,
  we establish an upper bound for the excess clustering risk. Moreover, we study the
  difference of the kernel weights learned from $n$ samples and $r$ points sampled
  without replacement, and derive its upper bound as $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k\cdot\sqrt{1/r-1/n})$.
  Based on the above results, we propose a novel strategy with Nystr√∂m method to enable
  SimpleMKKM to handle large-scale datasets with a theoretical learning guarantee.
  Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results and
  the effectiveness of the proposed large-scale strategy.
