title: Dimension-independent Certified Neural Network Watermarks via Mollifier Smoothing
openreview: lO5sAPGWqv
abstract: Certified_Watermarks is the first to provide a watermark certificate against
  $l_2$-norm watermark removal attacks, by leveraging the randomized smoothing techniques
  for certified robustness to adversarial attacks. However, the randomized smoothing
  techniques suffer from hardness of certified robustness in high-dimensional space
  against $l_p$-norm attacks for large $p$ ($p>2$). The certified watermark method
  based on the randomized smoothing is no exception, i.e., fails to provide meaningful
  certificates in high-dimensional space against the $l_p$-norm watermark removal
  attacks ($p>2$). By leveraging mollifier theory, this paper proposes a mollifier
  smoothing method with dimension-independent certified radius of our proposed smooth
  classifier, for conducting the certified watermark problem against the $l_p$-norm
  watermark removal attacks ($1 \leq p \leq \infty$) for high parameter dimension
  $d$. Based on partial differential equation (PDE) theory, an approximation of mollifier
  smoothing is developed to alleviate the inefficiency of sampling and prediction
  in the randomized smoothing as well as numerical integration in the mollifier smoothing,
  while maintaining the certified watermark against the $l_p$-norm watermark removal
  attacks ($1 \leq p \leq \infty$).
