title: Sequential Predictive Conformal Inference for Time Series
openreview: jJeY7w8YRz
abstract: We present a new distribution-free conformal prediction algorithm for sequential
  data (e.g., time series), called the <em>sequential predictive conformal inference</em>
  (SPCI). We specifically account for the nature that time series data are non-exchangeable,
  and thus many existing conformal prediction algorithms are not applicable. The main
  idea is to adaptively re-estimate the conditional quantile of non-conformity scores
  (e.g., prediction residuals), upon exploiting the temporal dependence among them.
  More precisely, we cast the problem of conformal prediction interval as predicting
  the quantile of a future residual, given a user-specified point prediction algorithm.
  Theoretically, we establish asymptotic valid conditional coverage upon extending
  consistency analyses in quantile regression. Using simulation and real-data experiments,
  we demonstrate a significant reduction in interval width of SPCI compared to other
  existing methods under the desired empirical coverage.
