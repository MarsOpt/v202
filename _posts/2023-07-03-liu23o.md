title: 'NUNO: A General Framework for Learning Parametric PDEs with Non-Uniform Data'
openreview: KobAWlZL29
abstract: The neural operator has emerged as a powerful tool in learning mappings
  between function spaces in PDEs. However, when faced with real-world physical data,
  which are often highly non-uniformly distributed, it is challenging to use mesh-based
  techniques such as the FFT. To address this, we introduce the Non-Uniform Neural
  Operator (NUNO), a comprehensive framework designed for efficient operator learning
  with non-uniform data. Leveraging a K-D tree-based domain decomposition, we transform
  non-uniform data into uniform grids while effectively controlling interpolation
  error, thereby paralleling the speed and accuracy of learning from non-uniform data.
  We conduct extensive experiments on 2D elasticity, (2+1)D channel flow, and a 3D
  multi-physics heatsink, which, to our knowledge, marks a novel exploration into
  3D PDE problems with complex geometries. Our framework has reduced error rates by
  up to 60% and enhanced training speeds by 2x to 30x. The code is now available at
  https://github.com/thu-ml/NUNO .
