title: Investigating the Role of Model-Based Learning in Exploration and Transfer
openreview: m21SgZnBWZ
abstract: 'State of the art reinforcement learning has enabled training agents on
  tasks of ever increasing complexity. However, the current paradigm tends to favor
  training agents from scratch on every new task or on collections of tasks with a
  view towards generalizing to novel task configurations. The former suffers from
  poor data efficiency while the latter is difficult when test tasks are out-of-distribution.
  Agents that can effectively transfer their knowledge about the world pose a potential
  solution to these issues. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning in the
  context of model-based agents. Specifically, we aim to understand where exactly
  environment models have an advantage and why. We find that a model-based approach
  outperforms controlled model-free baselines for transfer learning. Through ablations,
  we show that both the policy and dynamics model learnt through exploration matter
  for successful transfer. We demonstrate our results across three domains which vary
  in their requirements for transfer: in-distribution procedural (Crafter), in-distribution
  identical (RoboDesk), and out-of-distribution (Meta-World). Our results show that
  intrinsic exploration combined with environment models present a viable direction
  towards agents that are self-supervised and able to generalize to novel reward functions.'
