title: 'In Search of Insights, Not Magic Bullets: Towards Demystification of the Model
  Selection Dilemma in Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation'
openreview: fOSihVI1FW
abstract: Personalized treatment effect estimates are often of interest in high-stakes
  applications – thus, before deploying a model estimating such effects in practice,
  one needs to be sure that the best candidate from the ever-growing machine learning
  toolbox for this task was chosen. Unfortunately, due to the absence of counterfactual
  information in practice, it is usually not possible to rely on standard validation
  metrics for doing so, leading to a well-known model selection dilemma in the treatment
  effect estimation literature. While some solutions have recently been investigated,
  systematic understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different model selection
  criteria is still lacking. In this paper, instead of attempting to declare a global
  ‘winner’, we therefore empirically investigate success- and failure modes of different
  selection criteria. We highlight that there is a complex interplay between selection
  strategies, candidate estimators and the data used for comparing them, and provide
  interesting insights into the relative (dis)advantages of different criteria alongside
  desiderata for the design of further illuminating empirical studies in this context.
