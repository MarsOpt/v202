title: A Conditional Normalizing Flow for Accelerated Multi-Coil MR Imaging
openreview: HpOVpztozV
abstract: Accelerated magnetic resonance (MR) imaging attempts to reduce acquisition
  time by collecting data below the Nyquist rate. As an ill-posed inverse problem,
  many plausible solutions exist, yet the majority of deep learning approaches generate
  only a single solution. We instead focus on sampling from the posterior distribution,
  which provides more comprehensive information for downstream inference tasks. To
  do this, we design a novel conditional normalizing flow (CNF) that infers the signal
  component in the measurement operatorâ€™s nullspace, which is later combined with
  measured data to form complete images. Using fastMRI brain and knee data, we demonstrate
  fast inference and accuracy that surpasses recent posterior sampling techniques
  for MRI. Code is available at https://github.com/jwen307/mri_cnf
