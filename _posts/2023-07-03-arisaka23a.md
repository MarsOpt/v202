title: Principled Acceleration of Iterative Numerical Methods Using Machine Learning
openreview: 2MbU8qSWL1
abstract: Iterative methods are ubiquitous in large-scale scientific computing applications,
  and a number of approaches based on meta-learning have been recently proposed to
  accelerate them. However, a systematic study of these approaches and how they differ
  from meta-learning is lacking. In this paper, we propose a framework to analyze
  such learning-based acceleration approaches, where one can immediately identify
  a departure from classical meta-learning. We theoretically show that this departure
  may lead to arbitrary deterioration of model performance, and at the same time,
  we identify a methodology to ameliorate it by modifying the loss objective, leading
  to a novel training method for learning-based acceleration of iterative algorithms.
  We demonstrate the significant advantage and versatility of the proposed approach
  through various numerical applications.
