title: '"Why did the Model Fail?": Attributing Model Performance Changes to Distribution
  Shifts'
openreview: LwSKljRST0
abstract: Machine learning models frequently experience performance drops under distribution
  shifts. The underlying cause of such shifts may be multiple simultaneous factors
  such as changes in data quality, differences in specific covariate distributions,
  or changes in the relationship between label and features. When a model does fail
  during deployment, attributing performance change to these factors is critical for
  the model developer to identify the root cause and take mitigating actions. In this
  work, we introduce the problem of attributing performance differences between environments
  to distribution shifts in the underlying data generating mechanisms. We formulate
  the problem as a cooperative game where the players are distributions. We define
  the value of a set of distributions to be the change in model performance when only
  this set of distributions has changed between environments, and derive an importance
  weighting method for computing the value of an arbitrary set of distributions. The
  contribution of each distribution to the total performance change is then quantified
  as its Shapley value. We demonstrate the correctness and utility of our method on
  synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world case studies, showing its effectiveness
  in attributing performance changes to a wide range of distribution shifts.
