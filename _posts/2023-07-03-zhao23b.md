title: 'Rockmate: an Efficient, Fast, Automatic and Generic Tool for Re-materialization
  in PyTorch'
openreview: wLAMOoL0KD
abstract: We propose Rockmate to control the memory requirements when training PyTorch
  DNN models. Rockmate is an automatic tool that starts from the model code and generates
  an equivalent model, using a predefined amount of memory for activations, at the
  cost of a few re-computations. Rockmate automatically detects the structure of computational
  and data dependencies and rewrites the initial model as a sequence of complex blocks.
  We show that such a structure is widespread and can be found in many models in the
  literature (Transformer based models, ResNet, RegNets,...). This structure allows
  us to solve the problem in a fast and efficient way, using an adaptation of Checkmate
  (too slow on the whole model but general) at the level of individual blocks and
  an adaptation of Rotor (fast but limited to sequential models) at the level of the
  sequence itself. We show through experiments on many models that Rockmate is as
  fast as Rotor and as efficient as Checkmate, and that it allows in many cases to
  obtain a significantly lower memory consumption for activations (by a factor of
  2 to 5) for a rather negligible overhead (of the order of 10% to 20%). Rockmate
  is open source and available at https://github.com/topal-team/rockmate.
