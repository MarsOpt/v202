title: On Sampling with Approximate Transport Maps
openreview: NfH2HRL8u6
abstract: Transport maps can ease the sampling of distributions with non-trivial geometries
  by transforming them into distributions that are easier to handle. The potential
  of this approach has risen with the development of Normalizing Flows (NF) which
  are maps parameterized with deep neural networks trained to push a reference distribution
  towards a target. NF-enhanced samplers recently proposed blend (Markov chain) Monte
  Carlo methods with either (i) proposal draws from the flow or (ii) a flow-based
  reparametrization. In both cases, the quality of the learned transport conditions
  performance. The present work clarifies for the first time the relative strengths
  and weaknesses of these two approaches. Our study concludes that multimodal targets
  can be reliably handled with flow-based proposals up to moderately high dimensions.
  In contrast, methods relying on reparametrization struggle with multimodality but
  are more robust otherwise in high-dimensional settings and under poor training.
  To further illustrate the influence of target-proposal adequacy, we also derive
  a new quantitative bound for the mixing time of the Independent Metropolis-Hastings
  sampler.
