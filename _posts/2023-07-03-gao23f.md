title: 'PAL: Program-aided Language Models'
openreview: M1fd9Z00sj
abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to
  perform arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, when provided with a few examples
  at test time ("few-shot prompting"). Much of this success can be attributed to prompting
  methods such as "chain-of-thought", which employ LLMs for both understanding the
  problem description by decomposing it into steps, as well as solving each step of
  the problem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this sort of step-by-step decomposition,
  LLMs often make logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solution part, even when
  the problem is decomposed correctly. In this paper, we present Program-Aided Language
  models (PAL): a novel approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems
  and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution
  step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural
  language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM,
  while solving is delegated to the interpreter. We demonstrate this synergy between
  a neural LLM and a symbolic interpreter across 13 mathematical, symbolic, and algorithmic
  reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and others. In all these natural language reasoning
  tasks, generating code using an LLM and reasoning using a Python interpreter leads
  to more accurate results than much larger models. For example, PAL using Codex achieves
  state-of-the-art few-shot accuracy on GSM8K, surpassing PaLM which uses chain-of-thought
  by absolute 15% top-1.'
