title: Facial Expression Recognition with Adaptive Frame Rate based on Multiple Testing
  Correction
openreview: DH11pt7S2t
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of the high computational complexity
  of video-based facial expression recognition. A novel sequential procedure is proposed
  with an adaptive frame rate selection in a short video fragment to speed up decision-making.
  We automatically adjust the frame rate and process fewer frames with a low frame
  rate for more straightforward videos and more frames for complex ones. To determine
  the frame rate at which an inference is sufficiently reliable, the Benjamini-Hochberg
  procedure from multiple comparisons theory is employed to control the false discovery
  rate. The main advantages of our method are an improvement of the trustworthiness
  of decision-making by maintaining only one hyper-parameter (false acceptance rate)
  and its applicability with arbitrary neural network models used as facial feature
  extractors without the need to re-train these models. An experimental study on datasets
  from ABAW and EmotiW challenges proves the superior performance (1.5-40 times faster)
  of the proposed approach compared to processing all frames and existing techniques
  with early exiting and adaptive frame selection.
