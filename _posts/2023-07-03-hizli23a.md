title: Causal Modeling of Policy Interventions From Treatment-Outcome Sequences
openreview: q7hlNyetZ2
abstract: A <em>treatment policy</em> defines when and what treatments are applied
  to affect some outcome of interest. Data-driven decision-making requires the ability
  to predict <em>what happens if a policy is changed</em>. Existing methods that predict
  how the outcome evolves under different scenarios assume that the tentative sequences
  of future treatments are fixed in advance, while in practice the treatments are
  determined stochastically by a policy and may depend, for example, on the efficiency
  of previous treatments. Therefore, the current methods are not applicable if the
  treatment policy is unknown or a counterfactual analysis is needed. To handle these
  limitations, we model the treatments and outcomes jointly in continuous time, by
  combining Gaussian processes and point processes. Our model enables the estimation
  of a treatment policy from observational sequences of treatments and outcomes, and
  it can predict the interventional and counterfactual progression of the outcome
  <em>after an intervention on the treatment policy</em> (in contrast with the causal
  effect of a single treatment). We show with real-world and semi-synthetic data on
  blood glucose progression that our method can answer causal queries more accurately
  than existing alternatives.
