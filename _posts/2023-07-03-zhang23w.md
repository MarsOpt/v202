title: 'FedCR: Personalized Federated Learning Based on Across-Client Common Representation
  with Conditional Mutual Information Regularization'
openreview: YDC5jTS3LR
abstract: In personalized federated learning (PFL), multiple clients train customized
  models to fulfill their personal objectives, which, however, are prone to overfitting
  to local data due to the heterogeneity and scarcity of local data. To address this,
  we propose from the information-theoretic perspective a personalized federated learning
  framework based on the common representation learned across clients, named FedCR.
  Specifically, we introduce to the local client update a regularizer that aims at
  minimizing the discrepancy between local and global conditional mutual information
  (CMI), such that clients are encouraged to learn and exploit the common representation.
  Upon this, each client learns individually a customized predictor (head), while
  the extractor (body) remains to be aggregated by the server. Our CMI regularizer
  leads to a theoretically sound alignment between the local and global stochastic
  feature distributions in terms of their Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. More importantly,
  by modeling the global joint feature distribution as a product of multiple local
  feature distributions, clients can efficiently extract diverse information from
  the global data but without need of the raw data from other clients. We further
  show that noise injection via feature alignment and ensemble of local predictors
  in FedCR would help enhance its generalization capability. Experiments on benchmark
  datasets demonstrate a consistent performance gain and better generalization behavior
  of FedCR.
