title: Beyond the Edge of Stability via Two-step Gradient Updates
openreview: AvwlrX9AQr
abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) is a powerful workhorse of modern machine learning
  thanks to its scalability and efficiency in high-dimensional spaces. Its ability
  to find local minimisers is only guaranteed for losses with Lipschitz gradients,
  where it can be seen as a ’bona-fide’ discretisation of an underlying gradient flow.
  Yet, many ML setups involving overparametrised models do not fall into this problem
  class, which has motivated research beyond the so-called ”Edge of Stability” (EoS),
  where the step-size crosses the admissibility threshold inversely proportional to
  the Lipschitz constant above. Perhaps surprisingly, GD has been empirically observed
  to still converge regardless of local instability and oscillatory behavior. The
  incipient theoretical analysis of this phenomena has mainly focused in the overparametrised
  regime, where the effect of choosing a large learning rate may be associated to
  a ‘Sharpness-Minimisation’ implicit regularisation within the manifold of minimisers,
  under appropriate asymptotic limits. In contrast, in this work we directly examine
  the conditions for such unstable convergence, focusing on simple, yet representative,
  learning problems, via analysis of two-step gradient updates. Specifically, we characterize
  a local condition involving third-order derivatives that guarantees existence and
  convergence to fixed points of the two-step updates, and leverage such property
  in a teacher-student setting, under population loss. Finally, starting from Matrix
  Factorization, we provide observations of period-2 orbit of GD in high-dimensional
  settings with intuition of its dynamics, along with exploration into more general
  settings.
