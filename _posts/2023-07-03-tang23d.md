title: Understanding Self-Predictive Learning for Reinforcement Learning
openreview: QFw5VRmoGw
abstract: 'We study the learning dynamics of self-predictive learning for reinforcement
  learning, a family of algorithms that learn representations by minimizing the prediction
  error of their own future latent representations. Despite its recent empirical success,
  such algorithms have an apparent defect: trivial representations (such as constants)
  minimize the prediction error, yet it is obviously undesirable to converge to such
  solutions. Our central insight is that careful designs of the optimization dynamics
  are critical to learning meaningful representations. We identify that a faster paced
  optimization of the predictor and semi-gradient updates on the representation, are
  crucial to preventing the representation collapse. Then in an idealized setup, we
  show self-predictive learning dynamics carries out spectral decomposition on the
  state transition matrix, effectively capturing information of the transition dynamics.
  Building on the theoretical insights, we propose bidirectional self-predictive learning,
  a novel self-predictive algorithm that learns two representations simultaneously.
  We examine the robustness of our theoretical insights with a number of small-scale
  experiments and showcase the promise of the novel representation learning algorithm
  with large-scale experiments.'
