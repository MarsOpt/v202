title: 'Spherical Fourier Neural Operators: Learning Stable Dynamics on the Sphere'
openreview: TwsJ9IOZDx
abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have proven to be an efficient and effective
  method for resolution-independent operator learning in a broad variety of application
  areas across scientific machine learning. A key reason for their success is their
  ability to accurately model long-range dependencies in spatio-temporal data by learning
  global convolutions in a computationally efficient manner. To this end, FNOs rely
  on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), however, DFTs cause visual and spectral
  artifacts as well as pronounced dissipation when learning operators in spherical
  coordinates by incorrectly assuming flat geometry. To overcome this limitation,
  we generalize FNOs on the sphere, introducing Spherical FNOs (SFNOs) for learning
  operators on spherical geometries. We apply SFNOs to forecasting atmo- spheric dynamics,
  and demonstrate stable autoregressive rollouts for a year of simulated time (1,460
  steps), while retaining physically plausible dynamics. The SFNO has important implications
  for machine learning-based simulation of climate dynamics that could eventually
  help accelerate our response to climate change.
