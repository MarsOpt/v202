title: Linear Causal Disentanglement via Interventions
openreview: 1VDuHddxtA
abstract: 'Causal disentanglement seeks a representation of data involving latent
  variables that are related via a causal model. A representation is identifiable
  if both the latent model and the transformation from latent to observed variables
  are unique. In this paper, we study observed variables that are a linear transformation
  of a linear latent causal model. Data from interventions are necessary for identifiability:
  if one latent variable is missing an intervention, we show that there exist distinct
  models that cannot be distinguished. Conversely, we show that a single intervention
  on each latent variable is sufficient for identifiability. Our proof uses a generalization
  of the RQ decomposition of a matrix that replaces the usual orthogonal and upper
  triangular conditions with analogues depending on a partial order on the rows of
  the matrix, with partial order determined by a latent causal model. We corroborate
  our theoretical results with a method for causal disentanglement. We show that the
  method accurately recovers a latent causal model on synthetic and semi-synthetic
  data and we illustrate a use case on a dataset of single-cell RNA sequencing measurements.'
