title: 'ProtST: Multi-Modality Learning of Protein Sequences and Biomedical Texts'
openreview: ZOOwHgxfR4
abstract: Current protein language models (PLMs) learn protein representations mainly
  based on their sequences, thereby well capturing co-evolutionary information, but
  they are unable to explicitly acquire protein functions, which is the end goal of
  protein representation learning. Fortunately, for many proteins, their textual property
  descriptions are available, where their various functions are also described. Motivated
  by this fact, we first build the ProtDescribe dataset to augment protein sequences
  with text descriptions of their functions and other important properties. Based
  on this dataset, we propose the ProtST framework to enhance Protein Sequence pre-training
  and understanding by biomedical Texts. During pre-training, we design three types
  of tasks, i.e., unimodal mask prediction, multimodal representation alignment and
  multimodal mask prediction, to enhance a PLM with protein property information with
  different granularities and, at the same time, preserve the PLMâ€™s original representation
  power. On downstream tasks, ProtST enables both supervised learning and zero-shot
  prediction. We verify the superiority of ProtST-induced PLMs over previous ones
  on diverse representation learning benchmarks. Under the zero-shot setting, we show
  the effectiveness of ProtST on zero-shot protein classification, and ProtST also
  enables functional protein retrieval from a large-scale database without any function
  annotation.
