title: Projected Tensor Power Method for Hypergraph Community Recovery
openreview: CcDKqUR546
abstract: This paper investigates the problem of exact community recovery in the symmetric
  $d$-uniform $(d \geq 2)$ hypergraph stochastic block model ($d$-HSBM). In this model,
  a $d$-uniform hypergraph with $n$ nodes is generated by first partitioning the $n$
  nodes into $K\geq 2$ equal-sized disjoint communities and then generating hyperedges
  with a probability that depends on the community memberships of $d$ nodes. Despite
  the non-convex and discrete nature of the maximum likelihood estimation problem,
  we develop a simple yet efficient iterative method, called the <em>projected tensor
  power method</em>, to tackle it. As long as the initialization satisfies a partial
  recovery condition in the logarithmic degree regime of the problem, we show that
  our proposed method can exactly recover the hidden community structure down to the
  information-theoretic limit with high probability. Moreover, our proposed method
  exhibits a competitive time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log^2n/\log\log n)$ when
  the aforementioned initialization condition is met. We also conduct numerical experiments
  to validate our theoretical findings.
