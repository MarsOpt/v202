title: Constrained Monotonic Neural Networks
openreview: wRgJwQKLmC
abstract: Wider adoption of neural networks in many critical domains such as finance
  and healthcare is being hindered by the need to explain their predictions and to
  impose additional constraints on them. Monotonicity constraint is one of the most
  requested properties in real-world scenarios and is the focus of this paper. One
  of the oldest ways to construct a monotonic fully connected neural network is to
  constrain signs on its weights. Unfortunately, this construction does not work with
  popular non-saturated activation functions as it can only approximate convex functions.
  We show this shortcoming can be fixed by constructing two additional activation
  functions from a typical unsaturated monotonic activation function and employing
  each of them on the part of neurons. Our experiments show this approach of building
  monotonic neural networks has better accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art
  methods, while being the simplest one in the sense of having the least number of
  parameters, and not requiring any modifications to the learning procedure or post-learning
  steps. Finally, we prove it can approximate any continuous monotone function on
  a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
