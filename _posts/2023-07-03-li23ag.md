title: Learning Antidote Data to Individual Unfairness
openreview: o4uSWuXnXK
abstract: Fairness is essential for machine learning systems deployed in high-stake
  applications. Among all fairness notions, individual fairness, deriving from a consensus
  that ‘similar individuals should be treated similarly,’ is a vital notion to describe
  fair treatment for individual cases. Previous studies typically characterize individual
  fairness as a prediction-invariant problem when perturbing sensitive attributes
  on samples, and solve it by Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) paradigm.
  However, such adversarial perturbations along a direction covering sensitive information
  used in DRO do not consider the inherent feature correlations or innate data constraints,
  therefore could mislead the model to optimize at off-manifold and unrealistic samples.
  In light of this drawback, in this paper, we propose to learn and generate antidote
  data that approximately follows the data distribution to remedy individual unfairness.
  These generated on-manifold antidote data can be used through a generic optimization
  procedure along with original training data, resulting in a pure pre-processing
  approach to individual unfairness, or can also fit well with the in-processing DRO
  paradigm. Through extensive experiments on multiple tabular datasets, we demonstrate
  our method resists individual unfairness at a minimal or zero cost to predictive
  utility compared to baselines.
