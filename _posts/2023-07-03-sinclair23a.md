title: Hindsight Learning for MDPs with Exogenous Inputs
openreview: B6FMRlnDQz
abstract: 'Many resource management problems require sequential decision-making under
  uncertainty, where the only uncertainty affecting the decision outcomes are exogenous
  variables outside the control of the decision-maker. We model these problems as
  Exo-MDPs (Markov Decision Processes with Exogenous Inputs) and design a class of
  data-efficient algorithms for them termed Hindsight Learning (HL). Our HL algorithms
  achieve data efficiency by leveraging a key insight: having samples of the exogenous
  variables, past decisions can be revisited in hindsight to infer counterfactual
  consequences that can accelerate policy improvements. We compare HL against classic
  baselines in the multi-secretary and airline revenue management problems. We also
  scale our algorithms to a business-critical cloud resource management problem â€“
  allocating Virtual Machines (VMs) to physical machines, and simulate their performance
  with real datasets from a large public cloud provider. We find that HL algorithms
  outperform domain-specific heuristics, as well as state-of-the-art reinforcement
  learning methods.'
