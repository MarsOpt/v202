title: Input uncertainty propagation through trained neural networks
openreview: oZ0owWGDKv
abstract: When physical sensors are involved, such as image sensors, the uncertainty
  over the input data is often a major component of the output uncertainty of machine
  learning models. In this work, we address the problem of input uncertainty propagation
  through trained neural networks. We do not rely on a Gaussian distribution assumption
  of the output or of any intermediate layer. We propagate instead a Gaussian Mixture
  Model (GMM) that offers much more flexibility, using the Split&Merge algorithm.
  This paper’s main contribution is the computation of a Wasserstein criterion to
  control the Gaussian splitting procedure for which theoretical guarantees of convergence
  on the output distribution estimates are derived. The methodology is tested against
  a wide range of datasets and networks. It shows robustness, and genericity and offers
  highly accurate output probability density function estimation while maintaining
  a reasonable computational cost compared with the standard Monte Carlo (MC) approach.
