title: Optimal Rates and Efficient Algorithms for Online Bayesian Persuasion
openreview: jiC1uCDIEe
abstract: Bayesian persuasion studies how an informed sender should influence beliefs
  of rational receivers that take decisions through Bayesian updating of a common
  prior. We focus on the online Bayesian persuasion framework, in which the sender
  repeatedly faces one or more receivers with unknown and adversarially selected types.
  First, we show how to obtain a tight $\tilde O(T^{1/2})$ regret bound in the case
  in which the sender faces a single receiver and has bandit feedback, improving over
  the best previously known bound of $\tilde O(T^{4/5})$. Then, we provide the first
  no-regret guarantees for the multi-receiver setting under bandit feedback. Finally,
  we show how to design no-regret algorithms with polynomial per-iteration running
  time by exploiting type reporting, thereby circumventing known complexity results
  on online Bayesian persuasion. We provide efficient algorithms guaranteeing a $O(T^{1/2})$
  regret upper bound both in the single- and multi-receiver scenario when type reporting
  is allowed.
