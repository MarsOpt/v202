title: Fisher Information Embedding for Node and Graph Learning
openreview: VLs7ZmctMf
abstract: Attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs), such as graph attention networks
  (GATs), have become popular neural architectures for processing graph-structured
  data and learning node embeddings. Despite their empirical success, these models
  rely on labeled data and the theoretical properties of these models have yet to
  be fully understood. In this work, we propose a novel attention-based node embedding
  framework for graphs. Our framework builds upon a hierarchical kernel for multisets
  of subgraphs around nodes (e.g. neighborhoods) and each kernel leverages the geometry
  of a smooth statistical manifold to compare pairs of multisets, by “projecting”
  the multisets onto the manifold. By explicitly computing node embeddings with a
  manifold of Gaussian mixtures, our method leads to a new attention mechanism for
  neighborhood aggregation. We provide theoretical insights into generalizability
  and expressivity of our embeddings, contributing to a deeper understanding of attention-based
  GNNs. We propose both efficient unsupervised and supervised methods for learning
  the embeddings. Through experiments on several node classification benchmarks, we
  demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing attention-based graph
  models like GATs. Our code is available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/fisher_information_embedding.
