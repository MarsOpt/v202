title: Learning to Bid in Repeated First-Price Auctions with Budgets
openreview: OQFR3p76OR
abstract: Budget management strategies in repeated auctions have received growing
  attention in online advertising markets. However, previous work on budget management
  in online bidding mainly focused on second-price auctions. The rapid shift from
  second-price auctions to first-price auctions for online ads in recent years has
  motivated the challenging question of how to bid in repeated first-price auctions
  while controlling budgets. In this work, we study the problem of learning in repeated
  first-price auctions with budgets. We design a dual-based algorithm that can achieve
  a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with full information feedback where
  the maximum competing bid is always revealed after each auction. We further consider
  the setting with one-sided information feedback where only the winning bid is revealed
  after each auction. We show that our modified algorithm can still achieve an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
  regret with mild assumptions on the bidderâ€™s value distribution. Finally, we complement
  the theoretical results with numerical experiments to confirm the effectiveness
  of our budget management policy.
