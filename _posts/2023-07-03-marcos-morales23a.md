title: Evaluating Unsupervised Denoising Requires Unsupervised Metrics
openreview: iEPLOBHHnh
abstract: 'Unsupervised denoising is a crucial challenge in real-world imaging applications.
  Unsupervised deep-learning methods have demonstrated impressive performance on benchmarks
  based on synthetic noise. However, no metrics exist to evaluate these methods in
  an unsupervised fashion. This is highly problematic for the many practical applications
  where ground-truth clean images are not available. In this work, we propose two
  novel metrics: the unsupervised mean squared error (MSE) and the unsupervised peak
  signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which are computed using only noisy data. We provide
  a theoretical analysis of these metrics, showing that they are asymptotically consistent
  estimators of the supervised MSE and PSNR. Controlled numerical experiments with
  synthetic noise confirm that they provide accurate approximations in practice. We
  validate our approach on real-world data from two imaging modalities: videos in
  raw format and transmission electron microscopy. Our results demonstrate that the
  proposed metrics enable unsupervised evaluation of denoising methods based exclusively
  on noisy data.'
