title: Accelerated Primal-Dual Methods for Convex-Strongly-Concave Saddle Point Problems
openreview: XO97x0cyRN
abstract: We investigate a primal-dual (PD) method for the saddle point problem (SPP)
  that uses a linear approximation of the primal function instead of the standard
  proximal step, resulting in a linearized PD (LPD) method. For convex-strongly concave
  SPP, we observe that the LPD method has a suboptimal dependence on the Lipschitz
  constant of the primal function. To fix this issue, we combine features of Accelerated
  Gradient Descent with the LPD method resulting in a single-loop Accelerated Linearized
  Primal-Dual (ALPD) method. ALPD method achieves the optimal gradient complexity
  when the SPP has a semi-linear coupling function. We also present an inexact ALPD
  method for SPPs with a general nonlinear coupling function that maintains the optimal
  gradient evaluations of the primal parts and significantly improves the gradient
  evaluations of the coupling term compared to the ALPD method. We verify our findings
  with numerical experiments.
