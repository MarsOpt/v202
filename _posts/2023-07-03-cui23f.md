title: Learning Dynamic Query Combinations for Transformer-based Object Detection
  and Segmentation
openreview: SAgKrtDkn1
abstract: Transformer-based detection and segmentation methods use a list of learned
  detection queries to retrieve information from the transformer network and learn
  to predict the location and category of one specific object from each query. We
  empirically find that random convex combinations of the learned queries are still
  good for the corresponding models. We then propose to learn a convex combination
  with dynamic coefficients based on the high-level semantics of the image. The generated
  dynamic queries, named as modulated queries, better capture the prior of object
  locations and categories in the different images. Equipped with our modulated queries,
  a wide range of DETR-based models achieve consistent and superior performance across
  multiple tasks (object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation)
  and on different benchmarks (MS COCO, CityScapes, YoutubeVIS).
