title: Evolving Semantic Prototype Improves Generative Zero-Shot Learning
openreview: bC1OiuLO4N
abstract: In zero-shot learning (ZSL), generative methods synthesize class-related
  sample features based on predefined semantic prototypes. They advance the ZSL performance
  by synthesizing unseen class sample features for better training the classifier.
  We observe that each classâ€™s predefined semantic prototype (also referred to as
  semantic embedding or condition) does not accurately match its real semantic prototype.
  So the synthesized visual sample features do not faithfully represent the real sample
  features, limiting the classifier training and existing ZSL performance. In this
  paper, we formulate this mismatch phenomenon as the visual-semantic domain shift
  problem. We propose a dynamic semantic prototype evolving (DSP) method to align
  the empirically predefined semantic prototypes and the real prototypes for class-related
  feature synthesis. The alignment is learned by refining sample features and semantic
  prototypes in a unified framework and making the synthesized visual sample features
  approach real sample features. After alignment, synthesized sample features from
  unseen classes are closer to the real sample features and benefit DSP to improve
  existing generative ZSL methods by 8.5%, 8.0%, and 9.7% on the standard CUB, SUN
  AWA2 datasets, the significant performance improvement indicates that evolving semantic
  prototype explores a virgin field in ZSL.
