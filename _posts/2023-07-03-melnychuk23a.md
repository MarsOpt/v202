title: Normalizing Flows for Interventional Density Estimation
openreview: aa6ejr9t49
abstract: Existing machine learning methods for causal inference usually estimate
  quantities expressed via the mean of potential outcomes (e.g., average treatment
  effect). However, such quantities do not capture the full information about the
  distribution of potential outcomes. In this work, we estimate the density of potential
  outcomes after interventions from observational data. For this, we propose a novel,
  fully-parametric deep learning method called Interventional Normalizing Flows. Specifically,
  we combine two normalizing flows, namely (i) a nuisance flow for estimating nuisance
  parameters and (ii) a target flow for parametric estimation of the density of potential
  outcomes. We further develop a tractable optimization objective based on a one-step
  bias correction for efficient and doubly robust estimation of the target flow parameters.
  As a result, our Interventional Normalizing Flows offer a properly normalized density
  estimator. Across various experiments, we demonstrate that our Interventional Normalizing
  Flows are expressive and highly effective, and scale well with both sample size
  and high-dimensional confounding. To the best of our knowledge, our Interventional
  Normalizing Flows are the first proper fully-parametric, deep learning method for
  density estimation of potential outcomes.
