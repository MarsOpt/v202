title: 'When Personalization Harms Performance: Reconsidering the Use of Group Attributes
  in Prediction'
openreview: 70sWtujQAU
abstract: Machine learning models are often personalized with categorical attributes
  that define groups. In this work, we show that personalization with <em>group attributes</em>
  can inadvertently reduce performance at a <em>group level</em> â€“ i.e., groups may
  receive unnecessarily inaccurate predictions by sharing their personal characteristics.
  We present formal conditions to ensure the <em>fair use</em> of group attributes
  in a prediction task, and describe how they can be checked by training one additional
  model. We characterize how fair use conditions be violated due to standard practices
  in model development, and study the prevalence of fair use violations in clinical
  prediction tasks. Our results show that personalization often fails to produce a
  tailored performance gain for every group who reports personal data, and underscore
  the need to evaluate fair use when personalizing models with characteristics that
  are protected, sensitive, self-reported, or costly to acquire.
