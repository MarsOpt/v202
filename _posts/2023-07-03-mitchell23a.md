title: 'DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature'
openreview: UiAyIILXRd
abstract: The increasing fluency and widespread usage of large language models (LLMs)
  highlight the desirability of corresponding tools aiding detection of LLM-generated
  text. In this paper, we identify a property of the structure of an LLM’s probability
  function that is useful for such detection. Specifically, we demonstrate that text
  sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model’s log
  probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based
  criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach,
  which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting
  a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text.
  It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations
  of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g., T5). We find
  DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample
  detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter
  GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for
  DetectGPT.
