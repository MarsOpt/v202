title: 'DP-Fast MH: Private, Fast, and Accurate Metropolis-Hastings for Large-Scale
  Bayesian Inference'
openreview: ksMYhj4XGf
abstract: Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for learning from complex
  data and reasoning under uncertainty. It has been widely applied in machine learning
  tasks such as medical diagnosis, drug design, and policymaking. In these common
  applications, data can be highly sensitive. Differential privacy (DP) offers data
  analysis tools with powerful worst-case privacy guarantees and has been developed
  as the leading approach in privacy-preserving data analysis. In this paper, we study
  Metropolis-Hastings (MH), one of the most fundamental MCMC methods, for large-scale
  Bayesian inference under differential privacy. While most existing private MCMC
  algorithms sacrifice accuracy and efficiency to obtain privacy, we provide the first
  exact and fast DP MH algorithm, using only a minibatch of data in most iterations.
  We further reveal, for the first time, a three-way trade-off among privacy, scalability
  (i.e. the batch size), and efficiency (i.e. the convergence rate), theoretically
  characterizing how privacy affects the utility and computational cost in Bayesian
  inference. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm
  in various experiments.
