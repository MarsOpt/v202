title: 'How to Trust Your Diffusion Model: A Convex Optimization Approach to Conformal
  Risk Control'
openreview: UyBZ4zIOzV
abstract: 'Score-based generative modeling, informally referred to as diffusion models,
  continue to grow in popularity across several important domains and tasks. While
  they provide high-quality and diverse samples from empirical distributions, important
  questions remain on the reliability and trustworthiness of these sampling procedures
  for their responsible use in critical scenarios. Conformal prediction is a modern
  tool to construct finite-sample, distribution-free uncertainty guarantees for any
  black-box predictor. In this work, we focus on image-to-image regression tasks and
  we present a generalization of the Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets (RCPS) procedure,
  that we term $K$-RCPS, which allows to $(i)$ provide entrywise calibrated intervals
  for future samples of any diffusion model, and $(ii)$ control a certain notion of
  risk with respect to a ground truth image with minimal mean interval length. Differently
  from existing conformal risk control procedures, ours relies on a novel convex optimization
  approach that allows for multidimensional risk control while provably minimizing
  the mean interval length. We illustrate our approach on two real-world image denoising
  problems: on natural images of faces as well as on computed tomography (CT) scans
  of the abdomen, demonstrating state of the art performance.'
