title: On Strengthening and Defending Graph Reconstruction Attack with Markov Chain
  Approximation
openreview: Vcl3qckVyh
abstract: 'Although powerful graph neural networks (GNNs) have boosted numerous real-world
  applications, the potential privacy risk is still underexplored. To close this gap,
  we perform the first comprehensive study of graph reconstruction attack that aims
  to reconstruct the adjacency of nodes. We show that a range of factors in GNNs can
  lead to the surprising leakage of private links. Especially by taking GNNs as a
  Markov chain and attacking GNNs via a flexible chain approximation, we systematically
  explore the underneath principles of graph reconstruction attack, and propose two
  information theory-guided mechanisms: (1) the chain-based attack method with adaptive
  designs for extracting more private information; (2) the chain-based defense method
  that sharply reduces the attack fidelity with moderate accuracy loss. Such two objectives
  disclose a critical belief that to recover better in attack, you must extract more
  multi-aspect knowledge from the trained GNN; while to learn safer for defense, you
  must forget more link-sensitive information in training GNNs. Empirically, we achieve
  state-of-the-art results on six datasets and three common GNNs. The code is publicly
  available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/MC-GRA.'
