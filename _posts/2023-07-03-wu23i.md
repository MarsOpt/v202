title: Stable Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
openreview: rSOMtDM1mB
abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) is crucial for identifying
  the variation of treatment effects across individuals or subgroups. Most existing
  methods estimate HTE by removing the confounding bias from imbalanced treatment
  assignments. However, these methods may produce unreliable estimates of treatment
  effects and potentially allocate suboptimal treatment arms for underrepresented
  populations. To improve the estimation accuracy of HTE for underrepresented populations,
  we propose a novel Stable CounterFactual Regression (StableCFR) to smooth the population
  distribution and upsample the underrepresented subpopulations, while balancing confounders
  between treatment and control groups. Specifically, StableCFR upsamples the underrepresented
  data using uniform sampling, where each disjoint subpopulation is weighted proportional
  to the Lebesgue measure of its support. Moreover, StableCFR balances covariates
  by using an epsilon-greedy matching approach. Empirical results on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our StableCFR on
  estimating HTE for underrepresented populations.
