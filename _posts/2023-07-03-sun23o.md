title: A Neural PDE Solver with Temporal Stencil Modeling
openreview: ghdyH3u8y3
abstract: 'Numerical simulation of non-linear partial differential equations plays
  a crucial role in modeling physical science and engineering phenomena, such as weather,
  climate, and aerodynamics. Recent Machine Learning (ML) models trained on low-resolution
  spatio-temporal signals have shown new promises in capturing important dynamics
  in high-resolution signals, under the condition that the models can effectively
  recover the missing details. However, this study shows that significant information
  is often lost in the low-resolution down-sampled features. To address such issues,
  we propose a new approach, namely Temporal Stencil Modeling (TSM), which combines
  the strengths of advanced time-series sequence modeling (with the HiPPO features)
  and state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers (with learnable stencil modeling). TSM aims
  to recover the lost information from the PDE trajectories and can be regarded as
  a temporal generalization of classic finite volume methods such as WENO. Our experimental
  results show that TSM achieves the new state-of-the-art simulation accuracy for
  2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulent flows: it significantly outperforms the
  previously reported best results by 19.9% in terms of the highly-correlated duration
  time, and reduces the inference latency into 80%. We also show a strong generalization
  ability of the proposed method to various out-of-distribution turbulent flow settings,
  as well as lower resolution or 1-D / 3-D settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Edward-Sun/TSM-PDE
