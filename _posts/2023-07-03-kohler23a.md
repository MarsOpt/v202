title: Rigid Body Flows for Sampling Molecular Crystal Structures
openreview: GAfus0XZCD
abstract: 'Normalizing flows (NF) are a class of powerful generative models that have
  gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to model complex distributions
  with high flexibility and expressiveness. In this work, we introduce a new type
  of normalizing flow that is tailored for modeling positions and orientations of
  multiple objects in three-dimensional space, such as molecules in a crystal. Our
  approach is based on two key ideas: first, we define smooth and expressive flows
  on the group of unit quaternions, which allows us to capture the continuous rotational
  motion of rigid bodies; second, we use the double cover property of unit quaternions
  to define a proper density on the rotation group. This ensures that our model can
  be trained using standard likelihood-based methods or variational inference with
  respect to a thermodynamic target density. We evaluate the method by training Boltzmann
  generators for two molecular examples, namely the multi-modal density of a tetrahedral
  system in an external field and the ice XI phase in the TIP4P water model. Our flows
  can be combined with flows operating on the internal degrees of freedom of molecules
  and constitute an important step towards the modeling of distributions of many interacting
  molecules.'
