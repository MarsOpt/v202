title: Benign Overfitting in Two-layer ReLU Convolutional Neural Networks
openreview: qmwtMuRh1j
abstract: Modern deep learning models with great expressive power can be trained to
  overfit the training data but still generalize well. This phenomenon is referred
  to as benign overfitting. Recently, a few studies have attempted to theoretically
  understand benign overfitting in neural networks. However, these works are either
  limited to neural networks with smooth activation functions or to the neural tangent
  kernel regime. How and when benign overfitting can occur in ReLU neural networks
  remains an open problem. In this work, we seek to answer this question by establishing
  algorithm-dependent risk bounds for learning two-layer ReLU convolutional neural
  networks with label-flipping noise. We show that, under mild conditions, the neural
  network trained by gradient descent can achieve near-zero training loss and Bayes
  optimal test risk. Our result also reveals a sharp transition between benign and
  harmful overfitting under different conditions on data distribution in terms of
  test risk. Experiments on synthetic data back up our theory.
