title: Masked Trajectory Models for Prediction, Representation, and Control
openreview: Qh0Gbq3lkh
abstract: We introduce Masked Trajectory Models (MTM) as a generic abstraction for
  sequential decision making. MTM takes a trajectory, such as a state-action sequence,
  and aims to reconstruct the trajectory conditioned on random subsets of the same
  trajectory. By training with a highly randomized masking pattern, MTM learns versatile
  networks that can take on different roles or capabilities, by simply choosing appropriate
  masks at inference time. For example, the same MTM network can be used as a forward
  dynamics model, inverse dynamics model, or even an offline RL agent. Through extensive
  experiments in several continuous control tasks, we show that the same MTM network
  – i.e. same weights – can match or outperform specialized networks trained for the
  aforementioned capabilities. Additionally, we find that state representations learned
  by MTM can significantly accelerate the learning speed of traditional RL algorithms.
  Finally, in offline RL benchmarks, we find that MTM is competitive with specialized
  offline RL algorithms, despite MTM being a generic self-supervised learning method
  without any explicit RL components. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/mtm.
