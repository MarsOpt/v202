title: 'Sharp Variance-Dependent Bounds in Reinforcement Learning: Best of Both Worlds
  in Stochastic and Deterministic Environments'
openreview: lVcLi1ZLlg
abstract: We study variance-dependent regret bounds for Markov decision processes
  (MDPs). Algorithms with variance-dependent regret guarantees can automatically exploit
  environments with low variance (e.g., enjoying constant regret on deterministic
  MDPs). The existing algorithms are either variance-independent or suboptimal. We
  first propose two new environment norms to characterize the fine-grained variance
  properties of the environment. For model-based methods, we design a variant of the
  MVP algorithm (Zhang et al., 2021a). We apply new analysis techniques to demonstrate
  that this algorithm enjoys variance-dependent bounds with respect to the norms we
  propose. In particular, this bound is simultaneously minimax optimal for both stochastic
  and deterministic MDPs, the first result of its kind. We further initiate the study
  on model-free algorithms with variance-dependent regret bounds by designing a reference-function-based
  algorithm with a novel capped-doubling reference update schedule. Lastly, we also
  provide lower bounds to complement our upper bounds.
