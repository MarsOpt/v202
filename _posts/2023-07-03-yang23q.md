title: What is Essential for Unseen Goal Generalization of Offline Goal-conditioned
  RL?
openreview: UrQySwOk4q
abstract: Offline goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) offers a way to train general-purpose
  agents from fully offline datasets. In addition to being conservative within the
  dataset, the generalization ability to achieve unseen goals is another fundamental
  challenge for offline GCRL. However, to the best of our knowledge, this problem
  has not been well studied yet. In this paper, we study out-of-distribution (OOD)
  generalization of offline GCRL both theoretically and empirically to identify factors
  that are important. In a number of experiments, we observe that weighted imitation
  learning enjoys better generalization than pessimism-based offline RL method. Based
  on this insight, we derive a theory for OOD generalization, which characterizes
  several important design choices. We then propose a new offline GCRL method, Generalizable
  Offline goAl-condiTioned RL (GOAT), by combining the findings from our theoretical
  and empirical studies. On a new benchmark containing 9 independent identically distributed
  (IID) tasks and 17 OOD tasks, GOAT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods
  by a large margin.
