title: 'Q-learning Decision Transformer: Leveraging Dynamic Programming for Conditional
  Sequence Modelling in Offline RL'
openreview: 6lETsLXxta
abstract: Recent works have shown that tackling offline reinforcement learning (RL)
  with a conditional policy produces promising results. The Decision Transformer (DT)
  combines the conditional policy approach and a transformer architecture, showing
  competitive performance against several benchmarks. However, DT lacks stitching
  ability – one of the critical abilities for offline RL to learn the optimal policy
  from sub-optimal trajectories. This issue becomes particularly significant when
  the offline dataset only contains sub-optimal trajectories. On the other hand, the
  conventional RL approaches based on Dynamic Programming (such as Q-learning) do
  not have the same limitation; however, they suffer from unstable learning behaviours,
  especially when they rely on function approximation in an off-policy learning setting.
  In this paper, we propose the Q-learning Decision Transformer (QDT) to address the
  shortcomings of DT by leveraging the benefits of Dynamic Programming (Q-learning).
  It utilises the Dynamic Programming results to relabel the return-to-go in the training
  data to then train the DT with the relabelled data. Our approach efficiently exploits
  the benefits of these two approaches and compensates for each other’s shortcomings
  to achieve better performance.
