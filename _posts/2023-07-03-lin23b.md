title: Hyperbolic Diffusion Embedding and Distance for Hierarchical Representation
  Learning
openreview: MM2vSRQMAR
abstract: Finding meaningful representations and distances of hierarchical data is
  important in many fields. This paper presents a new method for hierarchical data
  embedding and distance. Our method relies on combining diffusion geometry, a central
  approach to manifold learning, and hyperbolic geometry. Specifically, using diffusion
  geometry, we build multi-scale densities on the data, aimed to reveal their hierarchical
  structure, and then embed them into a product of hyperbolic spaces. We show theoretically
  that our embedding and distance recover the underlying hierarchical structure. In
  addition, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and its advantages
  compared to existing methods on graph embedding benchmarks and hierarchical datasets.
