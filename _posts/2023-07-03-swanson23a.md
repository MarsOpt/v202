title: Von Mises Mixture Distributions for Molecular Conformation Generation
openreview: W6LjGzW8Kk
abstract: Molecules are frequently represented as graphs, but the underlying 3D molecular
  geometry (the locations of the atoms) ultimately determines most molecular properties.
  However, most molecules are not static and at room temperature adopt a wide variety
  of geometries or $\textit{conformations}$. The resulting distribution on geometries
  $p(x)$ is known as the Boltzmann distribution, and many molecular properties are
  expectations computed under this distribution. Generating accurate samples from
  the Boltzmann distribution is therefore essential for computing these expectations
  accurately. Traditional sampling-based methods are computationally expensive, and
  most recent machine learning-based methods have focused on identifying $\textit{modes}$
  in this distribution rather than generating true $\textit{samples}$. Generating
  such samples requires capturing conformational variability, and it has been widely
  recognized that the majority of conformational variability in molecules arises from
  rotatable bonds. In this work, we present VonMisesNet, a new graph neural network
  that captures conformational variability via a variational approximation of rotatable
  bond torsion angles as a mixture of von Mises distributions. We demonstrate that
  VonMisesNet can generate conformations for arbitrary molecules in a way that is
  both physically accurate with respect to the Boltzmann distribution and orders of
  magnitude faster than existing sampling methods.
