title: 'Shortest Edit Path Crossover: A Theory-driven Solution to the Permutation
  Problem in Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search'
openreview: WEHswL8qgO
abstract: 'Population-based search has recently emerged as a possible alternative
  to Reinforcement Learning (RL) for black-box neural architecture search (NAS). It
  performs well in practice even though it is not theoretically well understood. In
  particular, whereas traditional population-based search methods such as evolutionary
  algorithms (EAs) draw much power from crossover operations, it is difficult to take
  advantage of them in NAS. The main obstacle is believed to be the permutation problem:
  The mapping between genotype and phenotype in traditional graph representations
  is many-to-one, leading to a disruptive effect of standard crossover. This paper
  presents the first theoretical analysis of the behaviors of mutation, crossover
  and RL in black-box NAS, and proposes a new crossover operator based on the shortest
  edit path (SEP) in graph space. The SEP crossover is shown theoretically to overcome
  the permutation problem, and as a result, have a better expected improvement compared
  to mutation, standard crossover and RL. Further, it empirically outperform these
  other methods on state-of-the-art NAS benchmarks. The SEP crossover therefore allows
  taking full advantage of population-based search in NAS, and the underlying theory
  can serve as a foundation for deeper understanding of black-box NAS methods in general.'
