title: 'On Pre-Training for Visuo-Motor Control: Revisiting a Learning-from-Scratch
  Baseline'
openreview: dvp30Hrijj
abstract: 'In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of pre-training for visuo-motor
  control tasks. We revisit a simple Learning-from-Scratch (LfS) baseline that incorporates
  data augmentation and a shallow ConvNet, and find that this baseline is surprisingly
  competitive with recent approaches (PVR, MVP, R3M) that leverage frozen visual representations
  trained on large-scale vision datasets â€“ across a variety of algorithms, task domains,
  and metrics in simulation and on a real robot. Our results demonstrate that these
  methods are hindered by a significant domain gap between the pre-training datasets
  and current benchmarks for visuo-motor control, which is alleviated by finetuning.
  Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future research in pre-training
  for control and hope that our simple yet strong baseline will aid in accurately
  benchmarking progress in this area. Code: https://github.com/gemcollector/learning-from-scratch.'
