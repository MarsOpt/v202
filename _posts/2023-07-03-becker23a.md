title: Predicting Ordinary Differential Equations with Transformers
openreview: LztkK0UZxS
abstract: 'We develop a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model that recovers
  scalar ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in symbolic form from irregularly
  sampled and noisy observations of a single solution trajectory. We demonstrate in
  extensive empirical evaluations that our model performs better or on par with existing
  methods in terms of accurate recovery across various settings. Moreover, our method
  is efficiently scalable: after one-time pretraining on a large set of ODEs, we can
  infer the governing law of a new observed solution in a few forward passes of the
  model.'
