title: Phase-aware Adversarial Defense for Improving Adversarial Robustness
openreview: EX3gxKQOoO
abstract: 'Deep neural networks have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial noise.
  Recent works show that exploring the impact of adversarial noise on intrinsic components
  of data can help improve adversarial robustness. However, the pattern closely related
  to human perception has not been deeply studied. In this paper, inspired by the
  cognitive science, we investigate the interference of adversarial noise from the
  perspective of image phase, and find ordinarily-trained models lack enough robustness
  against phase-level perturbations. Motivated by this, we propose a joint adversarial
  defense method: a <em>phase-level adversarial training mechanism</em> to enhance
  the adversarial robustness on the phase pattern; an <em>amplitude-based pre-processing
  operation</em> to mitigate the adversarial perturbation in the amplitude pattern.
  Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the
  robust accuracy against multiple attacks and even adaptive attacks. In addition,
  ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense strategy.'
