title: Decentralized Stochastic Bilevel Optimization with Improved per-Iteration Complexity
openreview: kwbi5BmlKd
abstract: Bilevel optimization recently has received tremendous attention due to its
  great success in solving important machine learning problems like meta learning,
  reinforcement learning, and hyperparameter optimization. Extending single-agent
  training on bilevel problems to the decentralized setting is a natural generalization,
  and there has been a flurry of work studying decentralized bilevel optimization
  algorithms. However, it remains unknown how to design the distributed algorithm
  with sample complexity and convergence rate comparable to SGD for stochastic optimization,
  and at the same time without directly computing the exact Hessian or Jacobian matrices.
  In this paper we propose such an algorithm. More specifically, we propose a novel
  decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization (DSBO) algorithm that only requires
  first order stochastic oracle, Hessian-vector product and Jacobian-vector product
  oracle. The sample complexity of our algorithm matches the currently best known
  results for DSBO, while our algorithm does not require estimating the full Hessian
  and Jacobian matrices, thereby possessing to improved per-iteration complexity.
