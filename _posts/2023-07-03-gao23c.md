title: Generalizing Neural Wave Functions
openreview: 2F3bt9s0iW
abstract: Recent neural network-based wave functions have achieved state-of-the-art
  accuracies in modeling ab-initio ground-state potential energy surface. However,
  these networks can only solve different spatial arrangements of the same set of
  atoms. To overcome this limitation, we present Graph-learned orbital embeddings
  (Globe), a neural network-based reparametrization method that can adapt neural wave
  functions to different molecules. Globe learns representations of local electronic
  structures that generalize across molecules via spatial message passing by connecting
  molecular orbitals to covalent bonds. Further, we propose a size-consistent wave
  function Ansatz, the Molecular orbital network (Moon), tailored to jointly solve
  Schrödinger equations of different molecules. In our experiments, we find Moon converging
  in 4.5 times fewer steps to similar accuracy as previous methods or to lower energies
  given the same time. Further, our analysis shows that Moon’s energy estimate scales
  additively with increased system sizes, unlike previous work where we observe divergence.
  In both computational chemistry and machine learning, we are the first to demonstrate
  that a single wave function can solve the Schrödinger equation of molecules with
  different atoms jointly.
