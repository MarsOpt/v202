title: Optimizing Mode Connectivity for Class Incremental Learning
openreview: ml9EmtlMiy
abstract: 'Class incremental learning (CIL) is one of the most challenging scenarios
  in continual learning. Existing work mainly focuses on strategies like memory replay,
  regularization, or dynamic architecture but ignores a crucial aspect: mode connectivity.
  Recent studies have shown that different minima can be connected by a low-loss valley,
  and ensembling over the valley shows improved performance and robustness. Motivated
  by this, we try to investigate the connectivity in CIL and find that the high-loss
  ridge exists along the linear connection between two adjacent continual minima.
  To dodge the ridge, we propose parameter-saving OPtimizing Connectivity (OPC) based
  on Fourier series and gradient projection for finding the low-loss path between
  minima. The optimized path provides infinite low-loss solutions. We further propose
  EOPC to ensemble points within a local bent cylinder to improve performance on learned
  tasks. Our scheme can serve as a plug-in unit, extensive experiments on CIFAR-100,
  ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show consistent improvements when adapting EOPC to
  existing representative CIL methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HaitaoWen/EOPC.'
