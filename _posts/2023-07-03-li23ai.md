title: 'GraphCleaner: Detecting Mislabelled Samples in Popular Graph Learning Benchmarks'
openreview: rxT5EVRNEu
abstract: 'Label errors have been found to be prevalent in popular text, vision, and
  audio datasets, which heavily influence the safe development and evaluation of machine
  learning algorithms. Despite increasing efforts towards improving the quality of
  generic data types, such as images and texts, the problem of mislabel detection
  in graph data remains underexplored. To bridge the gap, we explore mislabelling
  issues in popular real-world graph datasets and propose GraphCleaner, a post-hoc
  method to detect and correct these mislabelled nodes in graph datasets. GraphCleaner
  combines the novel ideas of 1) Synthetic Mislabel Dataset Generation, which seeks
  to generate realistic mislabels; and 2) Neighborhood-Aware Mislabel Detection, where
  neighborhood dependency is exploited in both labels and base classifier predictions.
  Empirical evaluations on 6 datasets and 6 experimental settings demonstrate that
  GraphCleaner outperforms the closest baseline, with an average improvement of $0.14$
  in F1 score, and $0.16$ in MCC. On real-data case studies, GraphCleaner detects
  real and previously unknown mislabels in popular graph benchmarks: PubMed, Cora,
  CiteSeer and OGB-arxiv; we find that at least 6.91% of PubMed data is mislabelled
  or ambiguous, and simply removing these mislabelled data can boost evaluation performance
  from 86.71% to 89.11%.'
