title: Stochastic Marginal Likelihood Gradients using Neural Tangent Kernels
openreview: ZOUxDkLxIQ
abstract: Selecting hyperparameters in deep learning greatly impacts its effectiveness
  but requires manual effort and expertise. Recent works show that Bayesian model
  selection with Laplace approximations can allow to optimize such hyperparameters
  just like standard neural network parameters using gradients and on the training
  data. However, estimating a single hyperparameter gradient requires a pass through
  the entire dataset, limiting the scalability of such algorithms. In this work, we
  overcome this issue by introducing lower bounds to the linearized Laplace approximation
  of the marginal likelihood. In contrast to previous estimators, these bounds are
  amenable to stochastic-gradient-based optimization and allow to trade off estimation
  accuracy against computational complexity. We derive them using the function-space
  form of the linearized Laplace, which can be estimated using the neural tangent
  kernel. Experimentally, we show that the estimators can significantly accelerate
  gradient-based hyperparameter optimization.
