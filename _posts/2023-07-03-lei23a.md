title: Generalization Analysis for Contrastive Representation Learning
openreview: c5K7gcd2Rw
abstract: Recently, contrastive learning has found impressive success in advancing
  the state of the art in solving various machine learning tasks. However, the existing
  generalization analysis is very limited or even not meaningful. In particular, the
  existing generalization error bounds depend linearly on the number $k$ of negative
  examples while it was widely shown in practice that choosing a large $k$ is necessary
  to guarantee good generalization of contrastive learning in downstream tasks. In
  this paper, we establish novel generalization bounds for contrastive learning which
  do not depend on $k$, up to logarithmic terms. Our analysis uses structural results
  on empirical covering numbers and Rademacher complexities to exploit the Lipschitz
  continuity of loss functions. For self-bounding Lipschitz loss functions, we further
  improve our results by developing optimistic bounds which imply fast rates in a
  low noise condition. We apply our results to learning with both linear representation
  and nonlinear representation by deep neural networks, for both of which we derive
  Rademacher complexity bounds to get improved generalization bounds.
