title: Active Learning based Structural Inference
openreview: 5Z31keXfbQ
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Active Learning based Structural
  Inference (ALaSI), to infer the existence of directed connections from observed
  agentsâ€™ states over a time period in a dynamical system. With the help of deep active
  learning, ALaSI is competent in learning the representation of connections with
  a relatively small pool of prior knowledge. Moreover, based on information theory,
  the proposed inter- and out-of-scope message learning pipelines are remarkably beneficial
  to structural inference for large dynamical systems. We evaluate ALaSI on various
  large datasets including simulated systems and real-world networks, to demonstrate
  that ALaSI is able to outperform previous methods in precisely inferring the existence
  of connections in large systems under either supervised learning or unsupervised
  learning.
