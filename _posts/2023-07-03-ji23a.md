title: Leveraging Label Non-Uniformity for Node Classification in Graph Neural Networks
openreview: HfUWnPeLLH
abstract: 'In node classification using graph neural networks (GNNs), a typical model
  generates logits for different class labels at each node. A softmax layer often
  outputs a label prediction based on the largest logit. We demonstrate that it is
  possible to infer hidden graph structural information from the dataset using these
  logits. We introduce the key notion of label non-uniformity, which is derived from
  the Wasserstein distance between the softmax distribution of the logits and the
  uniform distribution. We demonstrate that nodes with small label non-uniformity
  are harder to classify correctly. We theoretically analyze how the label non-uniformity
  varies across the graph, which provides insights into boosting the model performance:
  increasing training samples with high non-uniformity or dropping edges to reduce
  the maximal cut size of the node set of small non-uniformity. These mechanisms can
  be easily added to a base GNN model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
  improves the performance of many benchmark base models.'
