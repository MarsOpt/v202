title: Efficient Parametric Approximations of Neural Network Function Space Distance
openreview: 3Ky05033V7
abstract: It is often useful to compactly summarize important properties of model
  parameters and training data so that they can be used later without storing and/or
  iterating over the entire dataset. As a specific case, we consider estimating the
  Function Space Distance (FSD) over a training set, i.e. the average discrepancy
  between the outputs of two neural networks. We propose a Linearized Activation Function
  TRick (LAFTR) and derive an efficient approximation to FSD for ReLU neural networks.
  The key idea is to approximate the architecture as a linear network with stochastic
  gating. Despite requiring only one parameter per unit of the network, our approach
  outcompetes other parametric approximations with larger memory requirements. Applied
  to continual learning, our parametric approximation is competitive with state-of-the-art
  nonparametric approximations, which require storing many training examples. Furthermore,
  we show its efficacy in estimating influence functions accurately and detecting
  mislabeled examples without expensive iterations over the entire dataset.
