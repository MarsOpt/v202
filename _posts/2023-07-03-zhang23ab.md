title: The Wisdom of Hindsight Makes Language Models Better Instruction Followers
openreview: xjGITa8bxl
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning has seen wide success in finetuning large language
  models to better align with instructions via human feedback. The so-called algorithm,
  Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) demonstrates impressive performance
  on the GPT series models. However, the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm
  is complex and requires additional training for reward and value networks. In this
  paper, we consider an alternative approach: converting feedback to instruction by
  relabeling the original one and training the model for better alignment in a supervised
  manner. Such an algorithm doesnâ€™t require any additional parameters except for the
  original language model and maximally reuses the pretraining pipeline. To achieve
  this, we formulate instruction alignment problem for language models as a goal-reaching
  problem in decision making. We propose Hindsight Instruction Relabeling (HIR), a
  novel algorithm for aligning language models with instructions. The resulting two-stage
  algorithm shed light to a family of reward-free approaches that utilize the hindsightly
  relabeled instructions based on feedback. We evaluate the performance of HIR extensively
  on 12 challenging BigBench reasoning tasks and show that HIR outperforms the baseline
  algorithms and is comparable to or even surpasses supervised fine-tuning. The implementation
  of HIR is available at https://github.com/tianjunz/HIR.'
