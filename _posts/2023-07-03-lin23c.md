title: Simplifying Momentum-based Positive-definite Submanifold Optimization with
  Applications to Deep Learning
openreview: l8K5vbrcd9
abstract: Riemannian submanifold optimization with momentum is computationally challenging
  because, to ensure that the iterates remain on the submanifold, we often need to
  solve difficult differential equations. Here, we simplify such difficulties for
  a class of structured symmetric positive-definite matrices with the affine-invariant
  metric. We do so by proposing a generalized version of the Riemannian normal coordinates
  that dynamically orthonormalizes the metric and locally converts the problem into
  an unconstrained problem in the Euclidean space. We use our approach to simplify
  existing approaches for structured covariances and develop matrix-inverse-free $2^\text{nd}$-order
  optimizers for deep learning in low precision settings.
