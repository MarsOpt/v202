title: Rethink DARTS Search Space and Renovate a New Benchmark
openreview: 2IkLprQjby
abstract: 'DARTS search space (DSS) has become a canonical benchmark for NAS whereas
  some emerging works pointed out the issue of narrow accuracy range and claimed it
  would hurt the method ranking. We observe some recent studies already suffer from
  this issue that overshadows the meaning of scores. In this work, we first propose
  and orchestrate a suite of improvements to frame a larger and harder DSS, termed
  LHD, while retaining high efficiency in search. We step forward to renovate a LHD-based
  new benchmark, taking care of both discernibility and accessibility. Specifically,
  we re-implement twelve baselines and evaluate them across twelve conditions by combining
  two underexpolored influential factors: transductive robustness and discretization
  policy, to reasonably construct a benchmark upon multi-condition evaluation. Considering
  that the tabular benchmarks are always insufficient to adequately evaluate the methods
  of neural architecture search (NAS), our work can serve as a crucial basis for the
  future progress of NAS.'
