title: Reachability-Aware Laplacian Representation in Reinforcement Learning
openreview: SHJaI92vWC
abstract: 'In Reinforcement Learning (RL), Laplacian Representation (LapRep) is a
  task-agnostic state representation that encodes the geometry of the environment.
  A desirable property of LapRep stated in prior works is that the Euclidean distance
  in the LapRep space roughly reflects the reachability between states, which motivates
  the usage of this distance for reward shaping. However, we find that LapRep does
  not necessarily have this property in general: two states having a small distance
  under LapRep can actually be far away in the environment. Such a mismatch would
  impede the learning process in reward shaping. To fix this issue, we introduce a
  Reachability-Aware Laplacian Representation (RA-LapRep), by properly scaling each
  dimension of LapRep. Despite the simplicity, we demonstrate that RA-LapRep can better
  capture the inter-state reachability as compared to LapRep, through both theoretical
  explanations and experimental results. Additionally, we show that this improvement
  yields a significant boost in reward shaping performance and benefits bottleneck
  state discovery.'
