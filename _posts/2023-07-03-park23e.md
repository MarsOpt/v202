title: Towards Understanding Ensemble Distillation in Federated Learning
openreview: Xx0TH4IKgQ
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm for
  data privacy preservation. Recently, a knowledge distillation (KD) based information
  sharing approach in FL, which conducts ensemble distillation on an unlabeled public
  dataset, has been proposed. However, despite its experimental success and usefulness,
  the theoretical analysis of the KD based approach has not been satisfactorily conducted.
  In this work, we build a theoretical foundation of the ensemble distillation framework
  in federated learning from the perspective of kernel ridge regression (KRR). In
  this end, we propose a KD based FL algorithm for KRR models which is related with
  some existing KD based FL algorithms, and analyze our algorithm theoretically. We
  show that our algorithm makes local prediction models as much powerful as the centralized
  KRR model (which is a KRR model trained by all of local datasets) in terms of the
  convergence rate of the generalization error if the unlabeled public dataset is
  sufficiently large. We also provide experimental results to verify our theoretical
  results on ensemble distillation in federated learning.
