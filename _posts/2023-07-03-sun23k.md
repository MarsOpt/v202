title: 'All in a Row: Compressed Convolution Networks for Graphs'
openreview: AHWSZhGXbs
abstract: Compared to Euclidean convolution, existing graph convolution methods generally
  fail to learn diverse convolution operators under limited parameter scales and depend
  on additional treatments of multi-scale feature extraction. The challenges of generalizing
  Euclidean convolution to graphs arise from the irregular structure of graphs. To
  bridge the gap between Euclidean space and graph space, we propose a differentiable
  method for regularization on graphs that applies permutations to the input graphs.
  The permutations constrain all nodes in a row regardless of their input order and
  therefore enable the flexible generalization of Euclidean convolution. Based on
  the regularization of graphs, we propose Compressed Convolution Network (CoCN) for
  hierarchical graph representation learning. CoCN follows the local feature learning
  and global parameter sharing mechanisms of Convolution Neural Networks. The whole
  model can be trained end-to-end and is able to learn both individual node features
  and the corresponding structure features. We validate CoCN on several node classification
  and graph classification benchmarks. CoCN achieves superior performance over competitive
  convolutional GNNs and graph pooling models. Codes are available at https://github.com/sunjss/CoCN.
