title: Learning-augmented private algorithms for multiple quantile release
openreview: Fgn23Fsmtv
abstract: When applying differential privacy to sensitive data, we can often improve
  performance using external information such as other sensitive data, public data,
  or human priors. We propose to use the learning-augmented algorithms (or algorithms
  with predictions) framework—previously applied largely to improve time complexity
  or competitive ratios—as a powerful way of designing and analyzing privacy-preserving
  methods that can take advantage of such external information to improve utility.
  This idea is instantiated on the important task of multiple quantile release, for
  which we derive error guarantees that scale with a natural measure of prediction
  quality while (almost) recovering state-of-the-art prediction-independent guarantees.
  Our analysis enjoys several advantages, including minimal assumptions about the
  data, a natural way of adding robustness, and the provision of useful surrogate
  losses for two novel ”meta” algorithms that learn predictions from other (potentially
  sensitive) data. We conclude with experiments on challenging tasks demonstrating
  that learning predictions across one or more instances can lead to large error reductions
  while preserving privacy.
