title: Interventional Causal Representation Learning
openreview: YiWzhu9pl6
abstract: Causal representation learning seeks to extract high-level latent factors
  from low-level sensory data. Most existing methods rely on observational data and
  structural assumptions (e.g., conditional independence) to identify the latent factors.
  However, interventional data is prevalent across applications. Can interventional
  data facilitate causal representation learning? We explore this question in this
  paper. The key observation is that interventional data often carries geometric signatures
  of the latent factors’ support (i.e. what values each latent can possibly take).
  For example, when the latent factors are causally connected, interventions can break
  the dependency between the intervened latents’ support and their ancestors’. Leveraging
  this fact, we prove that the latent causal factors can be identified up to permutation
  and scaling given data from perfect do interventions. Moreover, we can achieve block
  affine identification, namely the estimated latent factors are only entangled with
  a few other latents if we have access to data from imperfect interventions. These
  results highlight the unique power of interventional data in causal representation
  learning; they can enable provable identification of latent factors without any
  assumptions about their distributions or dependency structure.
