title: 'Adversarial Example Does Good: Preventing Painting Imitation from Diffusion
  Models via Adversarial Examples'
openreview: Wbquvk97t4
abstract: 'Recently, Diffusion Models (DMs) boost a wave in AI for Art yet raise new
  copyright concerns, where infringers benefit from using unauthorized paintings to
  train DMs and generate novel paintings in a similar style. To address these emerging
  copyright violations, in this paper, we are the first to explore and propose to
  utilize adversarial examples for DMs to protect human-created artworks. Specifically,
  we first build a theoretical framework to define and evaluate the adversarial examples
  for DMs. Then, based on this framework, we design a novel algorithm to generate
  these adversarial examples, named AdvDM, which exploits a Monte-Carlo estimation
  of adversarial examples for DMs by optimizing upon different latent variables sampled
  from the reverse process of DMs. Extensive experiments show that the generated adversarial
  examples can effectively hinder DMs from extracting their features. Therefore, our
  method can be a powerful tool for human artists to protect their copyright against
  infringers equipped with DM-based AI-for-Art applications. The code of our method
  is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mist-project/mist.git.'
