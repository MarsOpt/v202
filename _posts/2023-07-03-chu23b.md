title: Shape-Guided Dual-Memory Learning for 3D Anomaly Detection
openreview: IkSGn9fcPz
abstract: We present a shape-guided expert-learning framework to tackle the problem
  of unsupervised 3D anomaly detection. Our method is established on the effectiveness
  of two specialized expert models and their synergy to localize anomalous regions
  from color and shape modalities. The first expert utilizes geometric information
  to probe 3D structural anomalies by modeling the implicit distance fields around
  local shapes. The second expert considers the 2D RGB features associated with the
  first expert to identify color appearance irregularities on the local shapes. We
  use the two experts to build the dual memory banks from the anomaly-free training
  samples and perform shape-guided inference to pinpoint the defects in the testing
  samples. Owing to the per-point 3D representation and the effective fusion scheme
  of complementary modalities, our method efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance
  on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset with better recall and lower false positive rates, as
  preferred in real applications.
