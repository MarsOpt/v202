title: Nearly Minimax Optimal Reinforcement Learning for Linear Markov Decision Processes
openreview: H4Fb5RZQgr
abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation.
  For episodic time-inhomogeneous linear Markov decision processes (linear MDPs) whose
  transition probability can be parameterized as a linear function of a given feature
  mapping, we propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves
  the nearly minimax optimal regret $\tilde O(d\sqrt{H^3K})$, where $d$ is the dimension
  of the feature mapping, $H$ is the planning horizon, and $K$ is the number of episodes.
  Our algorithm is based on a weighted linear regression scheme with a carefully designed
  weight, which depends on a new variance estimator that (1) directly estimates the
  variance of the <em>optimal</em> value function, (2) monotonically decreases with
  respect to the number of episodes to ensure a better estimation accuracy, and (3)
  uses a rare-switching policy to update the value function estimator to control the
  complexity of the estimated value function class. Our work provides a complete answer
  to optimal RL with linear MDPs, and the developed algorithm and theoretical tools
  may be of independent interest.
