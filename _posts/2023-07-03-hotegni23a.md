title: Approximation Algorithms for Fair Range Clustering
openreview: gBoKJT5JhM
abstract: This paper studies the fair range clustering problem in which the data points
  are from different demographic groups and the goal is to pick $k$ centers with the
  minimum clustering cost such that each group is at least minimally represented in
  the centers set and no group dominates the centers set. More precisely, given a
  set of $n$ points in a metric space $(P, d)$ where each point belongs to one of
  the $\ell$ different demographics (i.e., $P = P_1 \uplus P_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus
  P_\ell$) and a set of $\ell$ intervals $[\alpha_1, \beta_1], \cdots, [\alpha_\ell,
  \beta_\ell]$ on desired number of centers from each group, the goal is to pick a
  set of $k$ centers $C$ with minimum $\ell_p$-clustering cost (i.e., $(\sum_{v\in
  P} d(v,C)^p)^{1/p}$) such that for each group $i\in \ell$, $|C\cap P_i| \in [\alpha_i,
  \beta_i]$. In particular, the fair range $\ell_p$-clustering captures fair range
  $k$-center, $k$-median and $k$-means as its special cases. In this work, we provide
  an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm for the fair range $\ell_p$-clustering
  for all values of $p\in [1,\infty)$.
