title: A Closer Look at Few-shot Classification Again
openreview: dkjqbwGCZg
abstract: Few-shot classification consists of a training phase where a model is learned
  on a relatively large dataset and an adaptation phase where the learned model is
  adapted to previously-unseen tasks with limited labeled samples. In this paper,
  we empirically prove that the training algorithm and the adaptation algorithm can
  be completely disentangled, which allows algorithm analysis and design to be done
  individually for each phase. Our meta-analysis for each phase reveals several interesting
  insights that may help better understand key aspects of few-shot classification
  and connections with other fields such as visual representation learning and transfer
  learning. We hope the insights and research challenges revealed in this paper can
  inspire future work in related directions. Code and pre-trained models (in PyTorch)
  are available at https://github.com/Frankluox/CloserLookAgainFewShot.
