title: Explainability as statistical inference
openreview: RPzQOi1Cyf
abstract: A wide variety of model explanation approaches have been proposed in recent
  years, all guided by very different rationales and heuristics. In this paper, we
  take a new route and cast interpretability as a statistical inference problem. We
  propose a general deep probabilistic model designed to produce interpretable predictions.
  The modelâ€™s parameters can be learned via maximum likelihood, and the method can
  be adapted to any predictor network architecture, and any type of prediction problem.
  Our model is akin to amortized interpretability methods, where a neural network
  is used as a selector to allow for fast interpretation at inference time. Several
  popular interpretability methods are shown to be particular cases of regularized
  maximum likelihood for our general model. Using our framework, we identify imputation
  as a common issue of these models. We propose new datasets with ground truth selection
  which allow for the evaluation of the features importance map and show experimentally
  that multiple imputation provides more reasonable interpretations.
