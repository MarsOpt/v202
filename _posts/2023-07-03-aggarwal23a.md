title: 'SemSup-XC: Semantic Supervision for Zero and Few-shot Extreme Classification'
openreview: kwb6T6LP7f
abstract: Extreme classification (XC) involves predicting over large numbers of classes
  (thousands to millions), with real-world applications like news article classification
  and e-commerce product tagging. The zero-shot version of this task requires generalization
  to novel classes without additional supervision. In this paper, we develop SemSup-XC,
  a model that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot and few-shot performance on three
  XC datasets derived from legal, e-commerce, and Wikipedia data. To develop SemSup-XC,
  we use automatically collected semantic class descriptions to represent classes
  and facilitate generalization through a novel hybrid matching module that matches
  input instances to class descriptions using a combination of semantic and lexical
  similarity. Trained with contrastive learning, SemSup-XC significantly outperforms
  baselines and establishes state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets considered,
  gaining up to 12 precision points on zero-shot and more than 10 precision points
  on one-shot tests, with similar gains for recall@10. Our ablation studies highlight
  the relative importance of our hybrid matching module and automatically collected
  class descriptions.
