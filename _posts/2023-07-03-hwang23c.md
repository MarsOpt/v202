title: Information-Theoretic State Space Model for Multi-View Reinforcement Learning
openreview: jwy77xkyPt
abstract: Multi-View Reinforcement Learning (MVRL) seeks to find an optimal control
  for an agent given multi-view observations from various sources. Despite recent
  advances in multi-view learning that aim to extract the latent representation from
  multi-view data, it is not straightforward to apply them to control tasks, especially
  when the observations are temporally dependent on one another. The problem can be
  even more challenging if the observations are intermittently missing for a subset
  of views. In this paper, we introduce Fuse2Control (F2C), an information-theoretic
  approach to capturing the underlying state space model from the sequences of multi-view
  observations. We conduct an extensive set of experiments in various control tasks
  showing that our method is highly effective in aggregating task-relevant information
  across many views, that scales linearly with the number of views while retaining
  robustness to arbitrary missing view scenarios.
