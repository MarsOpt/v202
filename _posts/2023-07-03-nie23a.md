title: Attributing Image Generative Models using Latent Fingerprints
openreview: mFE1SBf6av
abstract: Generative models have enabled the creation of contents that are indistinguishable
  from those taken from nature. Open-source development of such models raised concerns
  about the risks of their misuse for malicious purposes. One potential risk mitigation
  strategy is to attribute generative models via fingerprinting. Current fingerprinting
  methods exhibit a significant tradeoff between robust attribution accuracy and generation
  quality while lacking design principles to improve this tradeoff. This paper investigates
  the use of latent semantic dimensions as fingerprints, from where we can analyze
  the effects of design variables, including the choice of fingerprinting dimensions,
  strength, and capacity, on the accuracy-quality tradeoff. Compared with previous
  SOTA, our method requires minimum computation and is more applicable to large-scale
  models. We use StyleGAN2 and the latent diffusion model to demonstrate the efficacy
  of our method.
