title: Learning to Decouple Complex Systems
openreview: S1QzeJR9yE
abstract: A complex system with cluttered observations may be a coupled mixture of
  multiple simple sub-systems corresponding to latent entities. Such sub-systems may
  hold distinct dynamics in the continuous-time domain; therein, complicated interactions
  between sub-systems also evolve over time. This setting is fairly common in the
  real world but has been less considered. In this paper, we propose a sequential
  learning approach under this setting by decoupling a complex system for handling
  irregularly sampled and cluttered sequential observations. Such decoupling brings
  about not only subsystems describing the dynamics of each latent entity but also
  a meta-system capturing the interaction between entities over time. Specifically,
  we argue that the meta-system evolving within a simplex is governed by projected
  differential equations (ProjDEs). We further analyze and provide neural-friendly
  projection operators in the context of Bregman divergence. Experimental results
  on synthetic and real-world datasets show the advantages of our approach when facing
  complex and cluttered sequential data compared to the state-of-the-art.
