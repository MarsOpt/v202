title: Social learning spontaneously emerges by searching optimal heuristics with
  deep reinforcement learning
openreview: hbgD1Wdcaq
abstract: How have individuals of social animals in nature evolved to learn from each
  other, and what would be the optimal strategy for such learning in a specific environment?
  Here, we address both problems by employing a deep reinforcement learning model
  to optimize the social learning strategies (SLSs) of agents in a cooperative game
  in a multi-dimensional landscape. Throughout the training for maximizing the overall
  payoff, we find that the agent spontaneously learns various concepts of social learning,
  such as copying, focusing on frequent and well-performing neighbors, self-comparison,
  long-term cooperation between agents, and the importance of balancing between individual
  and social learning, without any explicit guidance or prior knowledge about the
  system. The SLS from a fully trained agent outperforms all of the traditional, baseline
  SLSs in terms of mean payoff. We demonstrate the superior performance of the reinforcement
  learning agent in various environments, including temporally changing environments
  and real social networks, which also verifies the adaptability of our framework
  to different social settings.
