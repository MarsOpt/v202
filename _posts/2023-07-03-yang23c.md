title: Towards Better Graph Representation Learning with Parameterized Decomposition
  & Filtering
openreview: OYIIEfy4zw
abstract: Proposing an effective and flexible matrix to represent a graph is a fundamental
  challenge that has been explored from multiple perspectives, e.g., filtering in
  Graph Fourier Transforms. In this work, we develop a novel and general framework
  which unifies many existing GNN models from the view of parameterized decomposition
  and filtering, and show how it helps to enhance the flexibility of GNNs while alleviating
  the smoothness and amplification issues of existing models. Essentially, we show
  that the extensively studied spectral graph convolutions with learnable polynomial
  filters are constrained variants of this formulation, and releasing these constraints
  enables our model to express the desired decomposition and filtering simultaneously.
  Based on this generalized framework, we develop models that are simple in implementation
  but achieve significant improvements and computational efficiency on a variety of
  graph learning tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/qslim/PDF.
