title: 'CHiLS: Zero-Shot Image Classification with Hierarchical Label Sets'
openreview: dOynYNAeHl
abstract: 'Open vocabulary models (e.g. CLIP) have shown strong performance on zero-shot
  classification through their ability generate embeddings for each class based on
  their (natural language) names. Prior work has focused on improving the accuracy
  of these models through prompt engineering or by incorporating a small amount of
  labeled downstream data (via finetuning). However, there has been little focus on
  improving the richness of the class names themselves, which can pose issues when
  class labels are coarsely-defined and are uninformative. We propose Classification
  with Hierarchical Label Sets (or CHiLS), an alternative strategy for zero-shot classification
  specifically designed for datasets with implicit semantic hierarchies. CHiLS proceeds
  in three steps: (i) for each class, produce a set of subclasses, using either existing
  label hierarchies or by querying GPT-3; (ii) perform the standard zero-shot CLIP
  procedure as though these subclasses were the labels of interest; (iii) map the
  predicted subclass back to its parent to produce the final prediction. Across numerous
  datasets with underlying hierarchical structure, CHiLS leads to improved accuracy
  in situations both with and without ground-truth hierarchical information. CHiLS
  is simple to implement within existing zero-shot pipelines and requires no additional
  training cost. Code is available at: https://github.com/acmi-lab/CHILS.'
