title: Improved Learning-Augmented Algorithms for the Multi-Option Ski Rental Problem
  via Best-Possible Competitive Analysis
openreview: OxkESnZnN2
abstract: In this paper, we present improved learning-augmented algorithms for the
  multi-option ski rental problem. Learning-augmented algorithms take ML predictions
  as an added part of the input and incorporates these predictions in solving the
  given problem. Due to their unique strength that combines the power of ML predictions
  with rigorous performance guarantees, they have been extensively studied in the
  context of online optimization problems. Even though ski rental problems are one
  of the canonical problems in the field of online optimization, only deterministic
  algorithms were previously known for multi-option ski rental, with or without learning
  augmentation. We present the first randomized learning-augmented algorithm for this
  problem, surpassing previous performance guarantees given by deterministic algorithms.
  Our learning-augmented algorithm is based on a new, provably best-possible randomized
  competitive algorithm for the problem. Our results are further complemented by lower
  bounds for deterministic and randomized algorithms, and computational experiments
  evaluating our algorithmsâ€™ performance improvements.
