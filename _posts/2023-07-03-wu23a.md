title: 'SEGA: Structural Entropy Guided Anchor View for Graph Contrastive Learning'
openreview: p32U4ulksI
abstract: In contrastive learning, the choice of "view" controls the information that
  the representation captures and influences the performance of the model. However,
  leading graph contrastive learning methods generally produce views via random corruption
  or learning, which could lead to the loss of essential information and alteration
  of semantic information. An anchor view that maintains the essential information
  of input graphs for contrastive learning has been hardly investigated. In this paper,
  based on the theory of graph information bottleneck, we deduce the definition of
  this anchor view; put differently, the anchor view with essential information of
  input graph is supposed to have the minimal structural uncertainty. Furthermore,
  guided by structural entropy, we implement the anchor view, termed SEGA, for graph
  contrastive learning. We extensively validate the proposed anchor view on various
  benchmarks regarding graph classification under unsupervised, semi-supervised, and
  transfer learning and achieve significant performance boosts compared to the state-of-the-art
  methods.
