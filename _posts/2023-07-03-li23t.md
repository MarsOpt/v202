title: Distribution-dependent McDiarmid-type Inequalities for Functions of Unbounded
  Interaction
openreview: DtFREFPHgu
abstract: The concentration of measure inequalities serves an essential role in statistics
  and machine learning. This paper gives unbounded analogues of the McDiarmid-type
  exponential inequalities for three popular classes of distributions, namely sub-Gaussian,
  sub-exponential and heavy-tailed distributions. The inequalities in the sub-Gaussian
  and sub-exponential cases are distribution-dependent compared with the recent results,
  and the inequalities in the heavy-tailed case are not available in the previous
  works. The usefulness of the inequalities is illustrated through applications to
  the sample mean, U-statistics and V-statistics.
