title: Analyzing Diffusion as Serial Reproduction
openreview: MG7msLCmBw
abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to synthesize
  samples by inverting a diffusion process that gradually maps data into noise. While
  these models have enjoyed great success recently, a full theoretical understanding
  of their observed properties is still lacking, in particular, their weak sensitivity
  to the choice of noise family and the role of adequate scheduling of noise levels
  for good synthesis. By identifying a correspondence between diffusion models and
  a well-known paradigm in cognitive science known as serial reproduction, whereby
  human agents iteratively observe and reproduce stimuli from memory, we show how
  the aforementioned properties of diffusion models can be explained as a natural
  consequence of this correspondence. We then complement our theoretical analysis
  with simulations that exhibit these key features. Our work highlights how classic
  paradigms in cognitive science can shed light on state-of-the-art machine learning
  problems.
