title: Compositional Score Modeling for Simulation-Based Inference
openreview: 5Q5wD1sAKj
abstract: Neural Posterior Estimation methods for simulation-based inference can be
  ill-suited for dealing with posterior distributions obtained by conditioning on
  multiple observations, as they tend to require a large number of simulator calls
  to learn accurate approximations. In contrast, Neural Likelihood Estimation methods
  can handle multiple observations at inference time after learning from individual
  observations, but they rely on standard inference methods, such as MCMC or variational
  inference, which come with certain performance drawbacks. We introduce a new method
  based on conditional score modeling that enjoys the benefits of both approaches.
  We model the scores of the (diffused) posterior distributions induced by individual
  observations, and introduce a way of combining the learned scores to approximately
  sample from the target posterior distribution. Our approach is sample-efficient,
  can naturally aggregate multiple observations at inference time, and avoids the
  drawbacks of standard inference methods.
