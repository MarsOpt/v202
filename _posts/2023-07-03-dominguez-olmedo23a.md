title: On Data Manifolds Entailed by Structural Causal Models
openreview: XAGr6u76Lu
abstract: 'The geometric structure of data is an important inductive bias in machine
  learning. In this work, we characterize the data manifolds entailed by structural
  causal models. The strengths of the proposed framework are twofold: firstly, the
  geometric structure of the data manifolds is causally informed, and secondly, it
  enables causal reasoning about the data manifolds in an interventional and a counterfactual
  sense. We showcase the versatility of the proposed framework by applying it to the
  generation of causally-grounded counterfactual explanations for machine learning
  classifiers, measuring distances along the data manifold in a differential geometric-principled
  manner.'
