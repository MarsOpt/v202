title: An Effective Meaningful Way to Evaluate Survival Models
openreview: zkdHgAKedJ
abstract: One straightforward metric to evaluate a survival prediction model is based
  on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – the average of the absolute difference between
  the time predicted by the model and the true event time, over all subjects. Unfortunately,
  this is challenging because, in practice, the test set includes (right) censored
  individuals, meaning we do not know when a censored individual actually experienced
  the event. In this paper, we explore various metrics to estimate MAE for survival
  datasets that include (many) censored individuals. Moreover, we introduce a novel
  and effective approach for generating realistic semi-synthetic survival datasets
  to facilitate the evaluation of metrics. Our findings, based on the analysis of
  the semi-synthetic datasets, reveal that our proposed metric (MAE using pseudo-observations)
  is able to rank models accurately based on their performance, and often closely
  matches the true MAE – in particular, is better than several alternative methods.
