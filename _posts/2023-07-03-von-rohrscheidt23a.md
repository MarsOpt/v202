title: Topological Singularity Detection at Multiple Scales
openreview: c6Wg91Xpbe
abstract: The manifold hypothesis, which assumes that data lies on or close to an
  unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension, is a staple of modern machine learning
  research. However, recent work has shown that real-world data exhibits distinct
  non-manifold structures, i.e. singularities, that can lead to erroneous findings.
  Detecting such singularities is therefore crucial as a precursor to interpolation
  and inference tasks. We address this issue by developing a topological framework
  that (i) quantifies the local intrinsic dimension, and (ii) yields a Euclidicity
  score for assessing the ’manifoldness’ of a point along multiple scales. Our approach
  identifies singularities of complex spaces, while also capturing singular structures
  and local geometric complexity in image data.
