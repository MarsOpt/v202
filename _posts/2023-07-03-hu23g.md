title: 'Learning to Learn from APIs: Black-Box Data-Free Meta-Learning'
openreview: r6p2HUDoG8
abstract: Data-free meta-learning (DFML) aims to enable efficient learning of new
  tasks by meta-learning from a collection of pre-trained models without access to
  the training data. Existing DFML work can only meta-learn from (i) white-box and
  (ii) small-scale pre-trained models (iii) with the same architecture, neglecting
  the more practical setting where the users only have inference access to the APIs
  with arbitrary model architectures and model scale inside. To solve this issue,
  we propose a Bi-level Data-free Meta Knowledge Distillation (BiDf-MKD) framework
  to transfer more general meta knowledge from a collection of black-box APIs to one
  single meta model. Specifically, by just querying APIs, we inverse each API to recover
  its training data via a zero-order gradient estimator and then perform meta-learning
  via a novel bi-level meta knowledge distillation structure, in which we design a
  boundary query set recovery technique to recover a more informative query set near
  the decision boundary. In addition, to encourage better generalization within the
  setting of limited API budgets, we propose task memory replay to diversify the underlying
  task distribution by covering more interpolated tasks. Extensive experiments in
  various real-world scenarios show the superior performance of our BiDf-MKD framework.
