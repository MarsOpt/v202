title: Learning Control by Iterative Inversion
openreview: KhizXcNnY6
abstract: We propose <em>iterative inversion</em> - an algorithm for learning an inverse
  function without input-output pairs, but only with samples from the desired output
  distribution and access to the forward function. The key challenge is a <em>distribution
  shift</em> between the desired outputs and the outputs of an initial random guess,
  and we prove that iterative inversion can steer the learning correctly, under rather
  strict conditions on the function. We apply iterative inversion to learn control.
  Our input is a set of demonstrations of desired behavior, given as video embeddings
  of trajectories (without actions), and our method iteratively learns to imitate
  trajectories generated by the current policy, perturbed by random exploration noise.
  Our approach does not require rewards, and only employs supervised learning, which
  can be easily scaled to use state-of-the-art trajectory embedding techniques and
  policy representations. Indeed, with a VQ-VAE embedding, and a transformer-based
  policy, we demonstrate non-trivial continuous control on several tasks (videos available
  at https://sites.google.com/view/iter-inver). Further, we report an improved performance
  on imitating diverse behaviors compared to reward based methods.
