title: When does Privileged information Explain Away Label Noise?
openreview: CnHxxjqkMi
abstract: Leveraging privileged information (PI), or features available during training
  but not at test time, has recently been shown to be an effective method for addressing
  label noise. However, the reasons for its effectiveness are not well understood.
  In this study, we investigate the role played by different properties of the PI
  in explaining away label noise. Through experiments on multiple datasets with real
  PI (CIFAR-N/H) and a new large-scale benchmark ImageNet-PI, we find that PI is most
  helpful when it allows networks to easily distinguish clean from noisy data, while
  enabling a learning shortcut to memorize the noisy examples. Interestingly, when
  PI becomes too predictive of the target label, PI methods often perform worse than
  their no-PI baselines. Based on these findings, we propose several enhancements
  to the state-of-the-art PI methods and demonstrate the potential of PI as a means
  of tackling label noise. Finally, we show how we can easily combine the resulting
  PI approaches with existing no-PI techniques designed to deal with label noise.
