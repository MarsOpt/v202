title: Learning Hidden Markov Models When the Locations of Missing Observations are
  Unknown
openreview: 5EVk1RXh3O
abstract: The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is one of the most widely used statistical
  models for sequential data analysis. One of the key reasons for this versatility
  is the ability of HMM to deal with missing data. However, standard HMM learning
  algorithms rely crucially on the assumption that the positions of the missing observations
  <em>within the observation sequence</em> are known. In the natural sciences, where
  this assumption is often violated, special variants of HMM, commonly known as Silent-state
  HMMs (SHMMs), are used. Despite their widespread use, these algorithms strongly
  rely on specific structural assumptions of the underlying chain, such as acyclicity,
  thus limiting the applicability of these methods. Moreover, even in the acyclic
  case, it has been shown that these methods can lead to poor reconstruction. In this
  paper we consider the general problem of learning an HMM from data with unknown
  missing observation locations. We provide reconstruction algorithms that do not
  require any assumptions about the structure of the underlying chain, and can also
  be used with limited prior knowledge, unlike SHMM. We evaluate and compare the algorithms
  in a variety of scenarios, measuring their reconstruction precision, and robustness
  under model miss-specification. Notably, we show that under proper specifications
  one can reconstruct the process dynamics as well as if the missing observations
  positions were known.
