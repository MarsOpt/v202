title: 'LongCoder: A Long-Range Pre-trained Language Model for Code Completion'
openreview: 6XwCseSnww
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new task for code completion that focuses
  on handling long code input and propose a sparse Transformer model, called LongCoder,
  to address this task. LongCoder employs a sliding window mechanism for self-attention
  and introduces two types of globally accessible tokens - bridge tokens and memory
  tokens - to improve performance and efficiency. Bridge tokens are inserted throughout
  the input sequence to aggregate local information and facilitate global interaction,
  while memory tokens are included to highlight important statements that may be invoked
  later and need to be memorized, such as package imports and definitions of classes,
  functions, or structures. We conduct experiments on a newly constructed dataset
  that contains longer code context and the publicly available CodeXGLUE benchmark.
  Experimental results demonstrate that LongCoder achieves superior performance on
  code completion tasks compared to previous models while maintaining comparable efficiency
  in terms of computational resources during inference.
