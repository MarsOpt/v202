title: 'RLSbench: Domain Adaptation Under Relaxed Label Shift'
openreview: b0xhqwNhez
abstract: 'Despite the emergence of principled methods for domain adaptation under
  label shift, their sensitivity to shifts in class conditional distributions is precariously
  under explored. Meanwhile, popular deep domain adaptation heuristics tend to falter
  when faced with label proportions shifts. While several papers modify these heuristics
  in attempts to handle label proportions shifts, inconsistencies in evaluation standards,
  datasets, and baselines make it difficult to gauge the current best practices. In
  this paper, we introduce RLSbench, a large-scale benchmark for <em>relaxed label
  shift</em>, consisting of $>$500 distribution shift pairs spanning vision, tabular,
  and language modalities, with varying label proportions. Unlike existing benchmarks,
  which primarily focus on shifts in class-conditional $p(x|y)$, our benchmark also
  focuses on label marginal shifts. First, we assess 13 popular domain adaptation
  methods, demonstrating more widespread failures under label proportion shifts than
  were previously known. Next, we develop an effective two-step meta-algorithm that
  is compatible with most domain adaptation heuristics: (i) <em>pseudo-balance</em>
  the data at each epoch; and (ii) adjust the final classifier with target label distribution
  estimate. The meta-algorithm improves existing domain adaptation heuristics under
  large label proportion shifts, often by 2â€“10% accuracy points, while conferring
  minimal effect ($<$0.5%) when label proportions do not shift. We hope that these
  findings and the availability of RLSbench will encourage researchers to rigorously
  evaluate proposed methods in relaxed label shift settings. Code is publicly available
  at https://github.com/acmi-lab/RLSbench.'
