title: Personalized Federated Learning with Inferred Collaboration Graphs
openreview: 33fj5Ph3ot
abstract: 'Personalized federated learning (FL) aims to collaboratively train a personalized
  model for each client. Previous methods do not adaptively determine who to collaborate
  at a fine-grained level, making them difficult to handle diverse data heterogeneity
  levels and those cases where malicious clients exist. To address this issue, our
  core idea is to learn a collaboration graph, which models the benefits from each
  pairwise collaboration and allocates appropriate collaboration strengths. Based
  on this, we propose a novel personalized FL algorithm, pFedGraph, which consists
  of two key modules: (1) inferring the collaboration graph based on pairwise model
  similarity and dataset size at server to promote fine-grained collaboration and
  (2) optimizing local model with the assistance of aggregated model at client to
  promote personalization. The advantage of pFedGraph is flexibly adaptive to diverse
  data heterogeneity levels and model poisoning attacks, as the proposed collaboration
  graph always pushes each client to collaborate more with similar and beneficial
  clients. Extensive experiments show that pFedGraph consistently outperforms the
  other $14$ baseline methods across various heterogeneity levels and multiple cases
  where malicious clients exist. Code will be available at https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/pFedGraph.'
