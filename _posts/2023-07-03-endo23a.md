title: Motion Question Answering via Modular Motion Programs
openreview: VTM0Bq7CWW
abstract: In order to build artificial intelligence systems that can perceive and
  reason with human behavior in the real world, we must first design models that conduct
  complex spatio-temporal reasoning over motion sequences. Moving towards this goal,
  we propose the HumanMotionQA task to evaluate complex, multi-step reasoning abilities
  of models on long-form human motion sequences. We generate a dataset of question-answer
  pairs that require detecting motor cues in small portions of motion sequences, reasoning
  temporally about when events occur, and querying specific motion attributes. In
  addition, we propose NSPose, a neuro-symbolic method for this task that uses symbolic
  reasoning and a modular design to ground motion through learning motion concepts,
  attribute neural operators, and temporal relations. We demonstrate the suitability
  of NSPose for the HumanMotionQA task, outperforming all baseline methods.
