title: Extrapolated Random Tree for Regression
openreview: uI8l8AENlj
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based algorithm named <em>Extrapolated
  Random Tree for Regression</em> (ERTR) that adapts to arbitrary smoothness of the
  regression function while maintaining the interpretability of the tree. We first
  put forward the <em>homothetic random tree for regression</em> (HRTR) that converges
  to the target function as the homothetic ratio approaches zero. Then ERTR uses a
  linear regression model to extrapolate HRTR estimations with different ratios to
  the ratio zero. From the theoretical perspective, we for the first time establish
  the optimal convergence rates for ERTR when the target function resides in the general
  HÃ¶lder space $C^{k,\alpha}$ for $k\in \mathbb{N}$, whereas the lower bound of the
  convergence rate of the random tree for regression (RTR) is strictly slower than
  ERTR in the space $C^{k,\alpha}$ for $k\geq 1$. This shows that ERTR outperforms
  RTR for the target function with high-order smoothness due to the extrapolation.
  In the experiments, we compare ERTR with state-of-the-art tree algorithms on real
  datasets to show the superior performance of our model. Moreover, promising improvements
  are brought by using the extrapolated trees as base learners in the extension of
  ERTR to ensemble methods.
