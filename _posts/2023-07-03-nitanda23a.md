title: Primal and Dual Analysis of Entropic Fictitious Play for Finite-sum Problems
openreview: xdT94ekVBh
abstract: The entropic fictitious play (EFP) is a recently proposed algorithm that
  minimizes the sum of a convex functional and entropy in the space of measures â€”
  such an objective naturally arises in the optimization of a two-layer neural network
  in the mean-field regime. In this work, we provide a concise primal-dual analysis
  of EFP in the setting where the learning problem exhibits a finite-sum structure.
  We establish quantitative global convergence guarantees for both the continuous-time
  and discrete-time dynamics based on properties of a proximal Gibbs measure introduced
  in Nitanda et al. (2022). Furthermore, our primal-dual framework entails a memory-efficient
  particle-based implementation of the EFP update, and also suggests a connection
  to gradient boosting methods. We illustrate the efficiency of our novel implementation
  in experiments including neural network optimization and image synthesis.
