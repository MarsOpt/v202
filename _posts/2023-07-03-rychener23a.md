title: 'End-to-End Learning for Stochastic Optimization: A Bayesian Perspective'
openreview: srcA0Dzooj
abstract: We develop a principled approach to end-to-end learning in stochastic optimization.
  First, we show that the standard end-to-end learning algorithm admits a Bayesian
  interpretation and trains a posterior Bayes action map. Building on the insights
  of this analysis, we then propose new end-to-end learning algorithms for training
  decision maps that output solutions of empirical risk minimization and distributionally
  robust optimization problems, two dominant modeling paradigms in optimization under
  uncertainty. Numerical results for a synthetic newsvendor problem illustrate the
  key differences between alternative training schemes. We also investigate an economic
  dispatch problem based on real data to showcase the impact of the neural network
  architecture of the decision maps on their test performance.
