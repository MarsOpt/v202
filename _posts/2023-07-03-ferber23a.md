title: 'SurCo: Learning Linear SURrogates for COmbinatorial Nonlinear Optimization
  Problems'
openreview: sSwN4NrzZr
abstract: 'Optimization problems with nonlinear cost functions and combinatorial constraints
  appear in many real-world applications but remain challenging to solve efficiently
  compared to their linear counterparts. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{\emph{\texttt{SurCo}}}$
  that learns linear $\underline{\text{Sur}}$rogate costs which can be used in existing
  $\underline{\text{Co}}$mbinatorial solvers to output good solutions to the original
  nonlinear combinatorial optimization problem. The surrogate costs are learned end-to-end
  with nonlinear loss by differentiating through the linear surrogate solver, combining
  the flexibility of gradient-based methods with the structure of linear combinatorial
  optimization. We propose three $\texttt{SurCo}$ variants: $\texttt{SurCo}-\texttt{zero}$
  for individual nonlinear problems, $\texttt{SurCo}-\texttt{prior}$ for problem distributions,
  and $\texttt{SurCo}-\texttt{hybrid}$ to combine both distribution and problem-specific
  information. We give theoretical intuition motivating $\texttt{SurCo}$, and evaluate
  it empirically. Experiments show that $\texttt{SurCo}$ finds better solutions faster
  than state-of-the-art and domain expert approaches in real-world optimization problems
  such as embedding table sharding, inverse photonic design, and nonlinear route planning.'
