title: 'Sketching Meets Differential Privacy: Fast Algorithm for Dynamic Kronecker
  Projection Maintenance'
openreview: fPytFuT5bO
abstract: Projection maintenance is one of the core data structure tasks. Efficient
  data structures for projection maintenance have led to recent breakthroughs in many
  convex programming algorithms. In this work, we further extend this framework to
  the Kronecker product structure. Given a constraint matrix ${\sf A}$ and a positive
  semi-definite matrix $W\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ with a sparse eigenbasis, we
  consider the task of maintaining the projection in the form of ${\sf B}^\top({\sf
  B}{\sf B}^\top)^{-1}{\sf B}$, where ${\sf B}={\sf A}(W\otimes I)$ or ${\sf B}={\sf
  A}(W^{1/2}\otimes W^{1/2})$. At each iteration, the weight matrix $W$ receives a
  low rank change and we receive a new vector $h$. The goal is to maintain the projection
  matrix and answer the query ${\sf B}^\top({\sf B}{\sf B}^\top)^{-1}{\sf B}h$ with
  good approximation guarantees. We design a fast dynamic data structure for this
  task and it is robust against an adaptive adversary. Following the beautiful and
  pioneering work of [Beimel, Kaplan, Mansour, Nissim, Saranurak and Stemmer, STOCâ€™22],
  we use tools from differential privacy to reduce the randomness required by the
  data structure and further improve the running time.
