title: From Adaptive Query Release to Machine Unlearning
openreview: IK2mgOCwt3
abstract: We formalize the problem of machine unlearning as design of efficient unlearning
  algorithms corresponding to learning algorithms which perform a selection of adaptive
  queries from structured query classes. We give efficient unlearning algorithms for
  linear and prefix-sum query classes. As applications, we show that unlearning in
  many problems, in particular, stochastic convex optimization (SCO), can be reduced
  to the above, yielding improved guarantees for the problem. In particular, for smooth
  Lipschitz losses and any $\rho>0$, our results yield an unlearning algorithm with
  excess population risk of $\tilde O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\rho}\big)$
  with unlearning query (gradient) complexity $\tilde O(\rho \cdot \text{Retraining
  Complexity})$, where $d$ is the model dimensionality and $n$ is the initial number
  of samples. For non-smooth Lipschitz losses, we give an unlearning algorithm with
  excess population risk $\tilde O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\rho}\big)^{1/2}\big)$
  with the same unlearning query (gradient) complexity. Furthermore, in the special
  case of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), such as those in linear and logistic regression,
  we get dimension-independent rates of $\tilde O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} +\frac{1}{(n\rho)^{2/3}}\big)$
  and $\tilde O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} +\frac{1}{(n\rho)^{1/3}}\big)$ for smooth Lipschitz
  and non-smooth Lipschitz losses respectively. Finally, we give generalizations of
  the above from one unlearning request to <em>dynamic</em> streams consisting of
  insertions and deletions.
