title: Graph Neural Networks can Recover the Hidden Features Solely from the Graph
  Structure
openreview: xQm5d5T30v
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular models for graph learning problems.
  GNNs show strong empirical performance in many practical tasks. However, the theoretical
  properties have not been completely elucidated. In this paper, we investigate whether
  GNNs can exploit the graph structure from the perspective of the expressive power
  of GNNs. In our analysis, we consider graph generation processes that are controlled
  by hidden (or latent) node features, which contain all information about the graph
  structure. A typical example of this framework is kNN graphs constructed from the
  hidden features. In our main results, we show that GNNs can recover the hidden node
  features from the input graph alone, even when all node features, including the
  hidden features themselves and any indirect hints, are unavailable. GNNs can further
  use the recovered node features for downstream tasks. These results show that GNNs
  can fully exploit the graph structure by themselves, and in effect, GNNs can use
  both the hidden and explicit node features for downstream tasks. In the experiments,
  we confirm the validity of our results by showing that GNNs can accurately recover
  the hidden features using a GNN architecture built based on our theoretical analysis.
