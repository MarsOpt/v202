title: Learning Physical Models that Can Respect Conservation Laws
openreview: WUF8WTF1MN
abstract: Recent work in scientific machine learning (SciML) has focused on incorporating
  partial differential equation (PDE) information into the learning process. Much
  of this work has focused on relatively "easy” PDE operators (e.g., elliptic and
  parabolic), with less emphasis on relatively “hard” PDE operators (e.g., hyperbolic).
  Within numerical PDEs, the latter problem class requires control of a type of volume
  element or conservation constraint, which is known to be challenging. Delivering
  on the promise of SciML requires seamlessly incorporating both types of problems
  into the learning process. To address this issue, we propose ProbConserv, a framework
  for incorporating constraints into a generic SciML architecture. To do so, ProbConserv
  combines the integral form of a conservation law with a Bayesian update. We provide
  a detailed analysis of ProbConserv on learning with the Generalized Porous Medium
  Equation (GPME), a widely-applicable parameterized family of PDEs that illustrates
  the qualitative properties of both easier and harder PDEs. ProbConserv is effective
  for easy GPME variants, performing well with state-of-the-art competitors; and for
  harder GPME variants it outperforms other approaches that do not guarantee volume
  conservation. ProbConserv seamlessly enforces physical conservation constraints,
  maintains probabilistic uncertainty quantification (UQ), and deals well with shocks
  and heteroscedasticity. In each case, it achieves superior predictive performance
  on downstream tasks.
