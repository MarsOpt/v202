title: Self-supervised learning of Split Invariant Equivariant representations
openreview: 2sIVxJ9Hp0
abstract: Recent progress has been made towards learning invariant or equivariant
  representations with self-supervised learning. While invariant methods are evaluated
  on large scale datasets, equivariant ones are evaluated in smaller, more controlled,
  settings. We aim at bridging the gap between the two in order to learn more diverse
  representations that are suitable for a wide range of tasks. We start by introducing
  a dataset called 3DIEBench, consisting of renderings from 3D models over 55 classes
  and more than 2.5 million images where we have full control on the transformations
  applied to the objects. We further introduce a predictor architecture based on hypernetworks
  to learn equivariant representations with no possible collapse to invariance. We
  introduce SIE (Split Invariant-Equivariant) which combines the hypernetwork-based
  predictor with representations split in two parts, one invariant, the other equivariant,
  to learn richer representations. We demonstrate significant performance gains over
  existing methods on equivariance related tasks from both a qualitative and quantitative
  point of view. We further analyze our introduced predictor and show how it steers
  the learned latent space. We hope that both our introduced dataset and approach
  will enable learning richer representations without supervision in more complex
  scenarios. Code and data are available at https://github.com/garridoq/SIE.
