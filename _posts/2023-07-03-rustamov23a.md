title: Intrinsic Sliced Wasserstein Distances for Comparing Collections of Probability
  Distributions on Manifolds and Graphs
openreview: tIJMebbcRF
abstract: Collections of probability distributions arise in a variety of applications
  ranging from user activity pattern analysis to brain connectomics. In practice these
  distributions can be defined over diverse domain types including finite intervals,
  circles, cylinders, spheres, other manifolds, and graphs. This paper introduces
  an approach for detecting differences between two collections of distributions over
  such general domains. To this end, we propose the intrinsic slicing construction
  that yields a novel class of Wasserstein distances on manifolds and graphs. These
  distances are Hilbert embeddable, allowing us to reduce the distribution collection
  comparison problem to a more familiar mean testing problem in a Hilbert space. We
  provide two testing procedures one based on resampling and another on combining
  p-values from coordinate-wise tests. Our experiments in various synthetic and real
  data settings show that the resulting tests are powerful and the p-values are well-calibrated.
