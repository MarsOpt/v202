title: Towards Unbiased Training in Federated Open-world Semi-supervised Learning
openreview: gHfybro5Sj
abstract: 'Federated Semi-supervised Learning (FedSSL) has emerged as a new paradigm
  for allowing distributed clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model
  over scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However, existing works for
  FedSSL rely on a closed-world assumption that all local training data and global
  testing data are from seen classes observed in the labeled dataset. It is crucial
  to go one step further: adapting FL models to an open-world setting, where unseen
  classes exist in the unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel <b>Fed</b>erated<b>o</b>pen-world
  <b>S</b>emi-<b>S</b>upervised <b>L</b>earning (<b>FedoSSL</b>) framework, which
  can solve the key challenge in distributed and open-world settings, i.e., the biased
  training process for heterogeneously distributed unseen classes. Specifically, since
  the advent of a certain unseen class depends on a client basis, the locally unseen
  classes (exist in multiple clients) are likely to receive differentiated superior
  aggregation effects than the globally unseen classes (exist only in one client).
  We adopt an uncertainty-aware suppressed loss to alleviate the biased training between
  locally unseen and globally unseen classes. Besides, we enable a calibration module
  supplementary to the global aggregation to avoid potential conflicting knowledge
  transfer caused by inconsistent data distribution among different clients. The proposed
  FedoSSL can be easily adapted to state-of-the-art FL methods, which is also validated
  via extensive experiments on benchmarks and real-world datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100
  and CINIC-10).'
