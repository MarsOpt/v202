title: Score Approximation, Estimation and Distribution Recovery of Diffusion Models
  on Low-Dimensional Data
openreview: KB4mLiuoEX
abstract: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance in various generation
  tasks. However, their theoretical foundations fall far behind. This paper studies
  score approximation, estimation, and distribution recovery of diffusion models,
  when data are supported on an unknown low-dimensional linear subspace. Our result
  provides sample complexity bounds for distribution estimation using diffusion models.
  We show that with a properly chosen neural network architecture, the score function
  can be both accurately approximated and efficiently estimated. Further, the generated
  distribution based on the estimated score function captures the data geometric structures
  and converges to a close vicinity of the data distribution. The convergence rate
  depends on subspace dimension, implying that diffusion models can circumvent the
  curse of data ambient dimensionality.
