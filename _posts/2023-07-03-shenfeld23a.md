title: 'TGRL: An Algorithm for Teacher Guided Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: Hk3m8Nh7mn
abstract: 'We consider solving sequential decision-making problems in the scenario
  where the agent has access to two supervision sources: $\textit{reward signal}$
  and a $\textit{teacher}$ that can be queried to obtain a $\textit{good}$ action
  for any state encountered by the agent. Learning solely from rewards, or reinforcement
  learning, is data inefficient and may not learn high-reward policies in challenging
  scenarios involving sparse rewards or partial observability. On the other hand,
  learning from a teacher may sometimes be infeasible. For instance, the actions provided
  by a teacher with privileged information may be unlearnable by an agent with limited
  information (i.e., partial observability). In other scenarios, the teacher might
  be sub-optimal, and imitating their actions can limit the agent’s performance. To
  overcome these challenges, prior work proposed to jointly optimize imitation and
  reinforcement learning objectives but relied on heuristics and problem-specific
  hyper-parameter tuning to balance the two objectives. We introduce Teacher Guided
  Reinforcement Learning (TGRL), a principled approach to dynamically balance following
  the teacher’s guidance and leveraging RL. TGRL outperforms strong baselines across
  diverse domains without hyperparameter tuning.'
