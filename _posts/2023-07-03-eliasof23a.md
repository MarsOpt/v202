title: Graph Positional Encoding via Random Feature Propagation
openreview: 1Nx2n1lk5T
abstract: 'Two main families of node feature augmentation schemes have been explored
  for enhancing GNNs: random features and spectral positional encoding. Surprisingly,
  however, there is still no clear understanding of the relation between these two
  augmentation schemes. Here we propose a novel family of positional encoding schemes
  which draws a link between the above two approaches and improves over both. The
  new approach, named Random Feature Propagation (RFP), is inspired by the power iteration
  method and its generalizations. It concatenates several intermediate steps of an
  iterative algorithm for computing the dominant eigenvectors of a propagation matrix,
  starting from random node features. Notably, these propagation steps are based on
  graph-dependent propagation operators that can be either predefined or learned.
  We explore the theoretical and empirical benefits of RFP. First, we provide theoretical
  justifications for using random features, for incorporating early propagation steps,
  and for using multiple random initializations. Then, we empirically demonstrate
  that RFP significantly outperforms both spectral PE and random features in multiple
  node classification and graph classification benchmarks.'
