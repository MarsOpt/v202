title: Robust Non-Linear Feedback Coding via Power-Constrained Deep Learning
openreview: 6ZgsnBQwYN
abstract: The design of codes for feedback-enabled communications has been a long-standing
  open problem. Recent research on non-linear, deep learning-based coding schemes
  have demonstrated significant improvements in communication reliability over linear
  codes, but are still vulnerable to the presence of forward and feedback noise over
  the channel. In this paper, we develop a new family of non-linear feedback codes
  that greatly enhance robustness to channel noise. Our autoencoder-based architecture
  is designed to learn codes based on consecutive blocks of bits, which obtains de-noising
  advantages over bit-by-bit processing to help overcome the physical separation between
  the encoder and decoder over a noisy channel. Moreover, we develop a power control
  layer at the encoder to explicitly incorporate hardware constraints into the learning
  optimization, and prove that the resulting average power constraint is satisfied
  asymptotically. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art
  feedback codes by wide margins over practical forward and feedback noise regimes,
  and provide information-theoretic insights on the behavior of our non-linear codes.
  Moreover, we observe that, in a long blocklength regime, canonical error correction
  codes are still preferable to feedback codes when the feedback noise becomes high.
