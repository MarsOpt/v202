title: Kernel Logistic Regression Approximation of an Understandable ReLU Neural Network
openreview: XW4R4LVKhw
abstract: This paper proposes an understandable neural network whose score function
  is modeled as an additive sum of univariate spline functions. It extends usual understandable
  models like generative additive models, spline-based models, and neural additive
  models. It is shown that this neural network can be approximated by a logistic regression
  whose inputs are obtained with a non-linear preprocessing of input data. This preprocessing
  depends on the neural network initialization but this paper establishes that it
  can be replaced by a non random kernel-based preprocessing that no longer depends
  on the initialization. Hence, the convergence of the training process is guaranteed
  and the solution is unique for a given training dataset.
