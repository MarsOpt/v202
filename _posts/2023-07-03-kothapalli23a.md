title: Randomized Schur Complement Views for Graph Contrastive Learning
openreview: x64pAA8OZZ
abstract: We introduce a randomized topological augmentor based on Schur complements
  for Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL). Given a graph laplacian matrix, the technique
  generates unbiased approximations of its Schur complements and treats the corresponding
  graphs as augmented views. We discuss the benefits of our approach, provide theoretical
  justifications and present connections with graph diffusion. Unlike previous efforts,
  we study the empirical effectiveness of the augmentor in a controlled fashion by
  varying the design choices for subsequent GCL phases, such as encoding and contrasting.
  Extensive experiments on node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that
  our technique consistently outperforms pre-defined and adaptive augmentation approaches
  to achieve state-of-the-art results.
