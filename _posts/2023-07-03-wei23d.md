title: Set-membership Belief State-based Reinforcement Learning for POMDPs
openreview: ot445h4SVB
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant progress in areas such
  as Atari games and robotic control, where the agents have perfect sensing capabilities.
  However, in many real-world sequential decision-making tasks, the observation data
  could be noisy or incomplete due to the intrinsic low quality of the sensors or
  unexpected malfunctions; that is, the agentâ€™s perceptions are rarely perfect. The
  current POMDP RL methods, such as particle-based and Gaussian-based, can only provide
  a probability estimate of hidden states rather than certain belief regions, which
  may lead to inefficient and even wrong decision-making. This paper proposes a novel
  algorithm called Set-membership Belief state-based Reinforcement Learning (SBRL),
  which consists of two parts: a Set-membership Belief state learning Model (SBM)
  for learning bounded belief state sets and an RL controller for making decisions
  based on SBM. We prove that our belief estimation method can provide a series of
  belief state sets that always contain the true states under the unknown-but-bounded
  (UBB) noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on a collection
  of benchmark tasks, and the results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
  methods.'
