title: The Dormant Neuron Phenomenon in Deep Reinforcement Learning
openreview: skb34O7hFp
abstract: In this work we identify the dormant neuron phenomenon in deep reinforcement
  learning, where an agentâ€™s network suffers from an increasing number of inactive
  neurons, thereby affecting network expressivity. We demonstrate the presence of
  this phenomenon across a variety of algorithms and environments, and highlight its
  effect on learning. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective method
  (ReDo) that Recycles Dormant neurons throughout training. Our experiments demonstrate
  that ReDo maintains the expressive power of networks by reducing the number of dormant
  neurons and results in improved performance.
