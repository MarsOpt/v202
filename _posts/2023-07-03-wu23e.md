title: Anchor Sampling for Federated Learning with Partial Client Participation
openreview: Ht9r3P6Lts
abstract: 'Compared with full client participation, partial client participation is
  a more practical scenario in federated learning, but it may amplify some challenges
  in federated learning, such as data heterogeneity. The lack of inactive clientsâ€™
  updates in partial client participation makes it more likely for the model aggregation
  to deviate from the aggregation based on full client participation. Training with
  large batches on individual clients is proposed to address data heterogeneity in
  general, but their effectiveness under partial client participation is not clear.
  Motivated by these challenges, we propose to develop a novel federated learning
  framework, referred to as FedAMD, for partial client participation. The core idea
  is anchor sampling, which separates partial participants into anchor and miner groups.
  Each client in the anchor group aims at the local bullseye with the gradient computation
  using a large batch. Guided by the bullseyes, clients in the miner group steer multiple
  near-optimal local updates using small batches and update the global model. By integrating
  the results of the two groups, FedAMD is able to accelerate the training process
  and improve the model performance. Measured by $\epsilon$-approximation and compared
  to the state-of-the-art methods, FedAMD achieves the convergence by up to $O(1/\epsilon)$
  fewer communication rounds under non-convex objectives. Empirical studies on real-world
  datasets validate the effectiveness of FedAMD and demonstrate the superiority of
  the proposed algorithm: Not only does it considerably save computation and communication
  costs, but also the test accuracy significantly improves.'
