title: Block Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform for Nyström Approximation on
  Distributed Architectures
openreview: EMN99LtfYA
abstract: This article introduces a novel structured random matrix composed blockwise
  from subsampled randomized Hadamard transforms (SRHTs). The block SRHT is expected
  to outperform well-known dimension reduction maps, including SRHT and Gaussian matrices
  on distributed architectures. We prove that a block SRHT with enough rows is an
  oblivious subspace embedding, i.e., an approximate isometry for an arbitrary low-dimensional
  subspace with high probability. Our estimate of the required number of rows is similar
  to that of the standard SRHT. This suggests that the two transforms should provide
  the same accuracy of approximation in the algorithms. The block SRHT can be readily
  incorporated into randomized methods for computing a low-rank approximation of a
  large-scale matrix, such as the Nyström method. For completeness, we revisit this
  method with a discussion of its implementation on distributed architectures.
