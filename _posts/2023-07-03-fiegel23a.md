title: Adapting to game trees in zero-sum imperfect information games
openreview: O1j4uFuSVW
abstract: 'Imperfect information games (IIG) are games in which each player only partially
  observes the current game state. We study how to learn $\epsilon$-optimal strategies
  in a zero-sum IIG through self-play with trajectory feedback. We give a problem-independent
  lower bound $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H(A_{\mathcal{X}}+B_{\mathcal{Y}})/\epsilon^2)$
  on the required number of realizations to learn these strategies with high probability,
  where $H$ is the length of the game, $A_{\mathcal{X}}$ and $B_{\mathcal{Y}}$ are
  the total number of actions for the two players. We also propose two Follow the
  Regularized leader (FTRL) algorithms for this setting: Balanced FTRL which matches
  this lower bound, but requires the knowledge of the information set structure beforehand
  to define the regularization; and Adaptive FTRL which needs $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^2(A_{\mathcal{X}}+B_{\mathcal{Y}})/\epsilon^2)$
  realizations without this requirement by progressively adapting the regularization
  to the observations.'
