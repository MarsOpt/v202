title: 'X-Paste: Revisiting Scalable Copy-Paste for Instance Segmentation using CLIP
  and StableDiffusion'
openreview: Xzc4CKcmnj
abstract: Copy-Paste is a simple and effective data augmentation strategy for instance
  segmentation. By randomly pasting object instances onto new background images, it
  creates new training data for free and significantly boosts the segmentation performance,
  especially for rare object categories. Although diverse, high-quality object instances
  used in Copy-Paste result in more performance gain, previous works utilize object
  instances either from human-annotated instance segmentation datasets or rendered
  from 3D object models, and both approaches are too expensive to scale up to obtain
  good diversity. In this paper, we revisit Copy-Paste at scale with the power of
  newly emerged zero-shot recognition models (e.g., CLIP) and text2image models (e.g.,
  StableDiffusion). We demonstrate for the first time that using a text2image model
  to generate images or zero-shot recognition model to filter noisily crawled images
  for different object categories is a feasible way to make Copy-Paste truly scalable.
  To make such success happen, we design a data acquisition and processing framework,
  dubbed â€œX-Paste", upon which a systematic study is conducted. On the LVIS dataset,
  X-Paste provides impressive improvements over the strong baseline CenterNet2 with
  Swin-L as the backbone. Specifically, it archives +2.6 box AP and +2.1 mask AP gains
  on all classes and even more significant gains with +6.8 box AP +6.5 mask AP on
  long-tail classes.
