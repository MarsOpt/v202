title: 'Run-off Election: Improved Provable Defense against Data Poisoning Attacks'
openreview: VpyyUM64AQ
abstract: 'In data poisoning attacks, an adversary tries to change a modelâ€™s prediction
  by adding, modifying, or removing samples in the training data. Recently, <em>ensemble-based</em>
  approaches for obtaining <em>provable</em> defenses against data poisoning have
  been proposed where predictions are done by taking a majority vote across multiple
  base models. In this work, we show that merely considering the majority vote in
  ensemble defenses is wasteful as it does not effectively utilize available information
  in the logits layers of the base models. Instead, we propose <em>Run-Off Election
  (ROE)</em>, a novel aggregation method based on a two-round election across the
  base models: In the first round, models vote for their preferred class and then
  a second, <em>Run-Off</em> election is held between the top two classes in the first
  round. Based on this approach, we propose DPA+ROE and FA+ROE defense methods based
  on Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA) and Finite Aggregation (FA) approaches from
  prior work. We evaluate our methods on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB and obtain improvements
  in certified accuracy by up to $3%$-$4%$. Also, by applying ROE on a boosted version
  of DPA, we gain improvements around $12%$-$27%$ comparing to the current state-of-the-art,
  establishing <b>a new state-of-the-art</b> in (pointwise) certified robustness against
  data poisoning. In many cases, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, even
  when using 32 times less computational power.'
