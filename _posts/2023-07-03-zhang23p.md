title: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning with Adversarial Contrastive Adaptation
openreview: thTcrwTATe
abstract: Spatial-temporal graph learning has emerged as the state-of-the-art solution
  for modeling structured spatial-temporal data in learning region representations
  for various urban sensing tasks (e.g., crime forecasting, traffic flow prediction).
  However, most existing models are vulnerable to the quality of the generated region
  graph due to the inartistic graph-structured information aggregation schema. The
  ubiquitous spatial-temporal data noise and incompleteness in real-life scenarios
  bring difficulties to generate high-quality region representations. In this paper,
  we propose a Spatial-Temporal Adversarial Graph contrastive learning model (STAG)
  to tackle this challenge for adaptive self-supervised graph augmentation. Specifically,
  we propose a learnable contrastive learning function that enables the automated
  distillation of important multi-view self-supervised signals for adaptive spatial-temporal
  graph augmentation. To enhance the representation discrimination ability and robustness,
  the designed adversarial contrastive learning mechanism empowers STAG to adaptively
  identify hard samples for better self-supervision. Finally, a cross-view contrastive
  learning paradigm is introduced to model the inter-dependencies across view-specific
  region representations and preserve the underlying relation heterogeneity. We verify
  the superiority of our STAG method in various spatial-temporal prediction tasks
  on several benchmark datasets.
