title: 'Neural Collapse in Deep Linear Networks: From Balanced to Imbalanced Data'
openreview: jjpsFetXJp
abstract: Modern deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance on tasks
  from image classification to natural language processing. Surprisingly, these complex
  systems with massive amounts of parameters exhibit the same structural properties
  in their last-layer features and classifiers across canonical datasets when training
  until convergence. In particular, it has been observed that the last-layer features
  collapse to their class-means, and those class-means are the vertices of a simplex
  Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). This phenomenon is known as Neural Collapse (NC).
  Recent papers have theoretically shown that NC emerges in the global minimizers
  of training problems with the simplified “unconstrained feature model”. In this
  context, we take a step further and prove the NC occurrences in deep linear networks
  for the popular mean squared error (MSE) and cross entropy (CE) losses, showing
  that global solutions exhibit NC properties across the linear layers. Furthermore,
  we extend our study to imbalanced data for MSE loss and present the first geometric
  analysis of NC under bias-free setting. Our results demonstrate the convergence
  of the last-layer features and classifiers to a geometry consisting of orthogonal
  vectors, whose lengths depend on the amount of data in their corresponding classes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analyses on synthetic and practical
  network architectures with both balanced and imbalanced scenarios.
