title: 'LinSATNet: The Positive Linear Satisfiability Neural Networks'
openreview: D2Oaj7v9YJ
abstract: Encoding constraints into neural networks is attractive. This paper studies
  how to introduce the popular positive linear satisfiability to neural networks.
  We propose the first differentiable satisfiability layer based on an extension of
  the classic Sinkhorn algorithm for jointly encoding multiple sets of marginal distributions.
  We further theoretically characterize the convergence property of the Sinkhorn algorithm
  for multiple marginals, and the underlying formulation is also derived. In contrast
  to the sequential decision e.g. reinforcement learning-based solvers, we showcase
  our technique in solving constrained (specifically satisfiability) problems by one-shot
  neural networks, including i) a neural routing solver learned without supervision
  of optimal solutions; ii) a partial graph matching network handling graphs with
  unmatchable outliers on both sides; iii) a predictive network for financial portfolios
  with continuous constraints. To our knowledge, there exists no one-shot neural solver
  for these scenarios when they are formulated as satisfiability problems. Source
