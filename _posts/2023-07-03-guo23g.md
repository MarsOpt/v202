title: 'FedBR: Improving Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data via Local Learning
  Bias Reduction'
openreview: nDKoVwNjMH
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a way for machines to learn from data that is
  kept locally, in order to protect the privacy of clients. This is typically done
  using local SGD, which helps to improve communication efficiency. However, such
  a scheme is currently constrained by slow and unstable convergence due to the variety
  of data on different clientsâ€™ devices. In this work, we identify three under-explored
  phenomena of biased local learning that may explain these challenges caused by local
  updates in supervised FL. As a remedy, we propose FedBR, a novel unified algorithm
  that reduces the local learning bias on features and classifiers to tackle these
  challenges. FedBR has two components. The first component helps to reduce bias in
  local classifiers by balancing the output of the models. The second component helps
  to learn local features that are similar to global features, but different from
  those learned from other data sources. We conducted several experiments to test
  FedBR and found that it consistently outperforms other SOTA FL methods. Both of
  its components also individually show performance gains. Our code is available at
