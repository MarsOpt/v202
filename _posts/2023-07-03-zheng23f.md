title: 'Revisiting Discriminative vs. Generative Classifiers: Theory and Implications'
openreview: I6xrc6HXIa
abstract: A large-scale deep model pre-trained on massive labeled or unlabeled data
  transfers well to downstream tasks. Linear evaluation freezes parameters in the
  pre-trained model and trains a linear classifier separately, which is efficient
  and attractive for transfer. However, little work has investigated the classifier
  in linear evaluation except for the default logistic regression. Inspired by the
  statistical efficiency of naive Bayes, the paper revisits the classical topic on
  discriminative vs. generative classifiers. Theoretically, the paper considers the
  surrogate loss instead of the zero-one loss in analyses and generalizes the classical
  results from binary cases to multiclass ones. We show that, under mild assumptions,
  multiclass naive Bayes requires $O(\log n)$ samples to approach its asymptotic error
  while the corresponding multiclass logistic regression requires $O(n)$ samples,
  where $n$ is the feature dimension. To establish it, we present a multiclass $\mathcal{H}$-consistency
  bound framework and an explicit bound for logistic loss, which are of independent
  interests. Simulation results on a mixture of Gaussian validate our theoretical
  findings. Experiments on various pre-trained deep vision models show that naive
  Bayes consistently converges faster as the number of data increases. Besides, naive
  Bayes shows promise in few-shot cases and we observe the "two regimes‚Äù phenomenon
  in pre-trained supervised models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/Revisiting-Dis-vs-Gen-Classifiers.
