title: Superhuman Fairness
openreview: i4SDT6qIIl
abstract: 'The fairness of machine learning-based decisions has become an increasingly
  important focus in the design of supervised machine learning methods. Most fairness
  approaches optimize a specified trade-off between performance measure(s) (e.g.,
  accuracy, log loss, or AUC) and fairness metric(s) (e.g., demographic parity, equalized
  odds). This begs the question: are the right performance-fairness trade-offs being
  specified? We instead re-cast fair machine learning as an imitation learning task
  by introducing superhuman fairness, which seeks to simultaneously outperform human
  decisions on multiple predictive performance and fairness measures. We demonstrate
  the benefits of this approach given suboptimal decisions.'
