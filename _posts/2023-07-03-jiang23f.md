title: Towards Stable and Efficient Adversarial Training against $l_1$ Bounded Adversarial
  Attacks
openreview: MUyvKR9cEB
abstract: We address the problem of stably and efficiently training a deep neural
  network robust to adversarial perturbations bounded by an $l_1$ norm. We demonstrate
  that achieving robustness against $l_1$-bounded perturbations is more challenging
  than in the $l_2$ or $l_\infty$ cases, because adversarial training against $l_1$-bounded
  perturbations is more likely to suffer from catastrophic overfitting and yield training
  instabilities. Our analysis links these issues to the coordinate descent strategy
  used in existing methods. We address this by introducing Fast-EG-$l_1$, an efficient
  adversarial training algorithm based on Euclidean geometry and free of coordinate
  descent. Fast-EG-$l_1$ comes with no additional memory costs and no extra hyper-parameters
  to tune. Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that Fast-EG-$l_1$
  yields the best and most stable robustness against $l_1$-bounded adversarial attacks
  among the methods of comparable computational complexity. Code and the checkpoints
  are available at https://github.com/IVRL/FastAdvL.
