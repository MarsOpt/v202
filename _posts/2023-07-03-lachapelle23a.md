title: 'Synergies between Disentanglement and Sparsity: Generalization and Identifiability
  in Multi-Task Learning'
openreview: SykskBAkZL
abstract: Although disentangled representations are often said to be beneficial for
  downstream tasks, current empirical and theoretical understanding is limited. In
  this work, we provide evidence that disentangled representations coupled with sparse
  task-specific predictors improve generalization. In the context of multi-task learning,
  we prove a new identifiability result that provides conditions under which maximally
  sparse predictors yield disentangled representations. Motivated by this theoretical
  result, we propose a practical approach to learn disentangled representations based
  on a sparsity-promoting bi-level optimization problem. Finally, we explore a meta-learning
  version of this algorithm based on group Lasso multiclass SVM predictors, for which
  we derive a tractable dual formulation. It obtains competitive results on standard
  few-shot classification benchmarks, while each task is using only a fraction of
  the learned representations.
