title: Flipping Coins to Estimate Pseudocounts for Exploration in Reinforcement Learning
openreview: 4RvcXByvnR
abstract: We propose a new method for count-based exploration in high-dimensional
  state spaces. Unlike previous work which relies on density models, we show that
  counts can be derived by averaging samples from the Rademacher distribution (or
  coin flips). This insight is used to set up a simple supervised learning objective
  which, when optimized, yields a state’s visitation count. We show that our method
  is significantly more effective at deducing ground-truth visitation counts than
  previous work; when used as an exploration bonus for a model-free reinforcement
  learning algorithm, it outperforms existing approaches on most of 9 challenging
  exploration tasks, including the Atari game Montezuma’s Revenge.
