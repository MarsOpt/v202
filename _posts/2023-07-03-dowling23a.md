title: Linear Time GPs for Inferring Latent Trajectories from Neural Spike Trains
openreview: 1hWB5XEUMa
abstract: Latent Gaussian process (GP) models are widely used in neuroscience to uncover
  hidden state evolutions from sequential observations, mainly in neural activity
  recordings. While latent GP models provide a principled and powerful solution in
  theory, the intractable posterior in non-conjugate settings necessitates approximate
  inference schemes, which may lack scalability. In this work, we propose cvHM, a
  general inference framework for latent GP models leveraging Hida-Matérn kernels
  and conjugate computation variational inference (CVI). With cvHM, we are able to
  perform variational inference of latent neural trajectories with linear time complexity
  for arbitrary likelihoods. The reparameterization of stationary kernels using Hida-Matérn
  GPs helps us connect the latent variable models that encode prior assumptions through
  dynamical systems to those that encode trajectory assumptions through GPs. In contrast
  to previous work, we use bidirectional information filtering, leading to a more
  concise implementation. Furthermore, we employ the Whittle approximate likelihood
  to achieve highly efficient hyperparameter learning.
