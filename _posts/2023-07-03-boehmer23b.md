title: 'Properties of the Mallows Model Depending on the Number of Alternatives: A
  Warning for an Experimentalist'
openreview: QwDUBbrvmB
abstract: The Mallows model is a popular distribution for ranked data. We empirically
  and theoretically analyze how the properties of rankings sampled from the Mallows
  model change when increasing the number of alternatives. We find that real-world
  data behaves differently from the Mallows model, yet is in line with its recent
  variant proposed by Boehmer et al. [IJCAI â€™21]. As part of our study, we issue several
  warnings about using the classic Mallows model. For instance, we find that one should
  be extremely careful when using the Mallows model to generate data for experiments
  with a varying number of alternatives, as observed trends in such experiments might
  be due to the changing nature of the generated data.
