title: Sequential Monte Carlo Learning for Time Series Structure Discovery
openreview: msZrQQAlBA
abstract: This paper presents a new approach to automatically discovering accurate
  models of complex time series data. Working within a Bayesian nonparametric prior
  over a symbolic space of Gaussian process time series models, we present a novel
  structure learning algorithm that integrates sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and involutive
  MCMC for highly effective posterior inference. Our method can be used both in "online”
  settings, where new data is incorporated sequentially in time, and in “offline”
  settings, by using nested subsets of historical data to anneal the posterior. Empirical
  measurements on real-world time series show that our method can deliver 10x–100x
  runtime speedups over previous MCMC and greedy-search structure learning algorithms
  targeting the same model family. We use our method to perform the first large-scale
  evaluation of Gaussian process time series structure learning on a prominent benchmark
  of 1,428 econometric datasets. The results show that our method discovers sensible
  models that deliver more accurate point forecasts and interval forecasts over multiple
  horizons as compared to widely used statistical and neural baselines that struggle
  on this challenging data.
