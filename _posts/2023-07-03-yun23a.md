title: Traversing Between Modes in Function Space for Fast Ensembling
openreview: Kw7g8iUNAw
abstract: Deep ensemble is a simple yet powerful way to improve the performance of
  deep neural networks. Under this motivation, recent works on mode connectivity have
  shown that parameters of ensembles are connected by low-loss subspaces, and one
  can efficiently collect ensemble parameters in those subspaces. While this provides
  a way to efficiently train ensembles, for inference, multiple forward passes should
  still be executed using all the ensemble parameters, which often becomes a serious
  bottleneck for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose a novel framework
  to reduce such costs. Given a low-loss subspace connecting two modes of a neural
  network, we build an additional neural network that predicts the output of the original
  neural network evaluated at a certain point in the low-loss subspace. The additional
  neural network, which we call a “bridge”, is a lightweight network that takes minimal
  features from the original network and predicts outputs for the low-loss subspace
  without forward passes through the original network. We empirically demonstrate
  that we can indeed train such bridge networks and significantly reduce inference
  costs with the help of bridge networks.
