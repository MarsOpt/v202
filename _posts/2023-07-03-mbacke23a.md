title: PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Adversarial Generative Models
openreview: Jpbyykdtmt
abstract: We extend PAC-Bayesian theory to generative models and develop generalization
  bounds for models based on the Wasserstein distance and the total variation distance.
  Our first result on the Wasserstein distance assumes the instance space is bounded,
  while our second result takes advantage of dimensionality reduction. Our results
  naturally apply to Wasserstein GANs and Energy-Based GANs, and our bounds provide
  new training objectives for these two. Although our work is mainly theoretical,
  we perform numerical experiments showing non-vacuous generalization bounds for Wasserstein
  GANs on synthetic datasets.
