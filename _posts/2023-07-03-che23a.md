title: Correcting discount-factor mismatch in on-policy policy gradient methods
openreview: GB0TdALWGw
abstract: 'The policy gradient theorem gives a convenient form of the policy gradient
  in terms of three factors: an action value, a gradient of the action likelihood,
  and a state distribution involving discounting called the <em>discounted stationary
  distribution</em>. But commonly used on-policy methods based on the policy gradient
  theorem ignores the discount factor in the state distribution, which is technically
  incorrect and may even cause degenerate learning behavior in some environments.
  An existing solution corrects this discrepancy by using $\gamma^t$ as a factor in
  the gradient estimate. However, this solution is not widely adopted and does not
  work well in tasks where the later states are similar to earlier states. We introduce
  a novel distribution correction to account for the discounted stationary distribution
  that can be plugged into many existing gradient estimators. Our correction circumvents
  the performance degradation associated with the $\gamma^t$ correction with a lower
  variance. Importantly, compared to the uncorrected estimators, our algorithm provides
  improved state emphasis to evade suboptimal policies in certain environments and
  consistently matches or exceeds the original performance on several OpenAI gym and
  DeepMind suite benchmarks.'
