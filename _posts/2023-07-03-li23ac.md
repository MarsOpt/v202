title: Low-Switching Policy Gradient with Exploration via Online Sensitivity Sampling
openreview: TbABBLMbtX
abstract: Policy optimization methods are powerful algorithms in Reinforcement Learning
  (RL) for their flexibility to deal with policy parameterization and ability to handle
  model misspecification. However, these methods usually suffer from slow convergence
  rates and poor sample complexity. Hence it is important to design provably sample
  efficient algorithms for policy optimization. Yet, recent advances for this problems
  have only been successful in tabular and linear setting, whose benign structures
  cannot be generalized to non-linearly parameterized policies. In this paper, we
  address this problem by leveraging recent advances in value-based algorithms, including
  bounded eluder-dimension and online sensitivity sampling, to design a low-switching
  sample-efficient policy optimization algorithm, <em>LPO</em>, with general non-linear
  function approximation. We show that, our algorithm obtains an $\varepsilon$-optimal
  policy with only $\widetilde{O}(\frac{\text{poly}(d)}{\varepsilon^3})$ samples,
  where $\varepsilon$ is the suboptimality gap and $d$ is a complexity measure of
  the function class approximating the policy. This drastically improves previously
  best-known sample bound for policy optimization algorithms, $\widetilde{O}(\frac{\text{poly}(d)}{\varepsilon^8})$.
  Moreover, we empirically test our theory with deep neural nets to show the benefits
  of the theoretical inspiration.
