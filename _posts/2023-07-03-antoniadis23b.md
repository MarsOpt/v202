title: Mixing Predictions for Online Metric Algorithms
openreview: HqQIt6mt5B
abstract: A major technique in learning-augmented online algorithms is combining multiple
  algorithms or predictors. Since the performance of each predictor may vary over
  time, it is desirable to use not the single best predictor as a benchmark, but rather
  a dynamic combination which follows different predictors at different times. We
  design algorithms that combine predictions and are competitive against such dynamic
  combinations for a wide class of online problems, namely, metrical task systems.
  Against the best (in hindsight) unconstrained combination of $\ell$ predictors,
  we obtain a competitive ratio of $O(\ell^2)$, and show that this is best possible.
  However, for a benchmark with slightly constrained number of switches between different
  predictors, we can get a $(1+\epsilon)$-competitive algorithm. Moreover, our algorithms
  can be adapted to access predictors in a bandit-like fashion, querying only one
  predictor at a time. An unexpected implication of one of our lower bounds is a new
  structural insight about covering formulations for the $k$-server problem.
