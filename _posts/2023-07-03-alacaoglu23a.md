title: Convergence of First-Order Methods for Constrained Nonconvex Optimization with
  Dependent Data
openreview: UZmfIzyTvW
abstract: We focus on analyzing the classical stochastic projected gradient methods
  under a general dependent data sampling scheme for constrained smooth nonconvex
  optimization. We show the worst-case rate of convergence $\tilde{O}(t^{-1/4})$ and
  complexity $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ for achieving an $\varepsilon$-near stationary
  point in terms of the norm of the gradient of Moreau envelope and gradient mapping.
  While classical convergence guarantee requires i.i.d. data sampling from the target
  distribution, we only require a mild mixing condition of the conditional distribution,
  which holds for a wide class of Markov chain sampling algorithms. This improves
  the existing complexity for the constrained smooth nonconvex optimization with dependent
  data from $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ with a
  significantly simpler analysis. We illustrate the generality of our approach by
  deriving convergence results with dependent data for stochastic proximal gradient
  methods, adaptive stochastic gradient algorithm AdaGrad and stochastic gradient
  algorithm with heavy ball momentum. As an application, we obtain first online nonnegative
  matrix factorization algorithms for dependent data based on stochastic projected
  gradient methods with adaptive step sizes and optimal rate of convergence.
