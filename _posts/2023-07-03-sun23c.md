title: Revisiting Sampling for Combinatorial Optimization
openreview: ZMP0Bki9aK
abstract: Sampling approaches like Markov chain Monte Carlo were once popular for
  combinatorial optimization, but the inefficiency of classical methods and the need
  for problem-specific designs curtailed ongoing development. Recent work has favored
  data-driven approaches that mitigate the need for hand-craft heuristics, but these
  are often not usable as out-of-the-box solvers due to dependence on in-distribution
  training and limited scalability to large instances. In this paper, we revisit the
  idea of using sampling for combinatorial optimization, motivated by the significant
  recent advances of gradient-based discrete MCMC and new techniques for parallel
  neighborhood exploration on accelerators. Remarkably, we find that modern sampling
  strategies can leverage landscape information to provide general-purpose solvers
  that require no training and yet are competitive with state of the art combinatorial
  solvers. In particular, experiments on cover vertex selection, graph partition and
  routing demonstrate better speed-quality trade-offs over current learning based
  approaches, and sometimes even superior performance to commercial solvers and specialized
  algorithms.
