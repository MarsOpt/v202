title: End-to-end Differentiable Clustering with Associative Memories
openreview: itr9tFVFZm
abstract: Clustering is a widely used unsupervised learning technique involving an
  intensive discrete optimization problem. Associative Memory models or AMs are differentiable
  neural networks defining a recursive dynamical system, which have been integrated
  with various deep learning architectures. We uncover a novel connection between
  the AM dynamics and the inherent discrete assignment necessary in clustering to
  propose a novel unconstrained continuous relaxation of the discrete clustering problem,
  enabling end-to-end differentiable clustering with AM, dubbed ClAM. Leveraging the
  pattern completion ability of AMs, we further develop a novel self-supervised clustering
  loss. Our evaluations on varied datasets demonstrate that ClAM benefits from the
  self-supervision, and significantly improves upon both the traditional Lloydâ€™s k-means
  algorithm, and more recent continuous clustering relaxations (by upto 60% in terms
  of the Silhouette Coefficient).
