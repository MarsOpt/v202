title: 'Men Also Do Laundry: Multi-Attribute Bias Amplification'
openreview: N6MQv7U9vD
abstract: 'The phenomenon of $\textit{bias amplification}$ occurs when models amplify
  training set biases at test time. Existing metrics measure bias amplification with
  respect to single annotated attributes (e.g., $\texttt{computer}$). However, large-scale
  datasets typically consist of instances with multiple attribute annotations (e.g.,
  $\{\texttt{computer}, \texttt{keyboard}\}$). We demonstrate models can learn to
  exploit correlations with respect to multiple attributes, which are not accounted
  for by current metrics. Moreover, we show that current metrics can give the erroneous
  impression that little to no bias amplification has occurred as they aggregate positive
  and negative bias scores. Further, these metrics lack an ideal value, making them
  difficult to interpret. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new metric:
  $\textit{Multi-Attribute Bias Amplification}$. We validate our metricâ€™s utility
  through a bias amplification analysis on the COCO, imSitu, and CelebA datasets.
  Finally, we benchmark bias mitigation methods using our proposed metric, suggesting
  possible avenues for future bias mitigation efforts.'
