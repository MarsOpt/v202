title: 'Mu$^2$SLAM: Multitask, Multilingual Speech and Language Models'
openreview: eIQIcUKs0T
abstract: We present Mu$^2$SLAM, a multilingual sequence-to-sequence model pre-trained
  jointly on unlabeled speech, unlabeled text and supervised data spanning Automatic
  Speech Recognition (ASR), Automatic Speech Translation (AST) and Machine Translation
  (MT), in over 100 languages. By leveraging a quantized representation of speech
  as a target, Mu$^2$SLAM trains the speech-text models with a sequence-to-sequence
  masked denoising objective similar to T5 on the decoder and a masked language modeling
  objective (MLM) on the encoder, for both unlabeled speech and text, while utilizing
  the supervised tasks to improve cross-lingual and cross-modal representation alignment
  within the model. On CoVoST AST, Mu$^2$SLAM establishes a new state-of-the-art for
  models trained on public datasets, improving on xx-en translation over the previous
  best by 1.9 BLEU points and on en-xx translation by 1.1 BLEU points. On Voxpopuli
  ASR, our model matches the performance of an mSLAM model fine-tuned with an RNN-T
  decoder, despite using a relatively weaker Transformer decoder. On text understanding
  tasks, our model improves by more than 6% over mSLAM on XNLI, getting closer to
  the performance of mT5 models of comparable capacity on XNLI and TydiQA, paving
  the way towards a single model for all speech and text understanding tasks.
