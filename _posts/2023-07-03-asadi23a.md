title: 'Prototype-Sample Relation Distillation: Towards Replay-Free Continual Learning'
openreview: ywwdhhqNj7
abstract: In Continual learning (CL) balancing effective adaptation while combating
  catastrophic forgetting is a central challenge. Many of the recent best-performing
  methods utilize various forms of prior task data, e.g. a replay buffer, to tackle
  the catastrophic forgetting problem. Having access to previous task data can be
  restrictive in many real-world scenarios, for example when task data is sensitive
  or proprietary. To overcome the necessity of using previous tasksâ€™ data, in this
  work, we start with strong representation learning methods that have been shown
  to be less prone to forgetting. We propose a holistic approach to jointly learn
  the representation and class prototypes while maintaining the relevance of old class
  prototypes and their embedded similarities. Specifically, samples are mapped to
  an embedding space where the representations are learned using a supervised contrastive
  loss. Class prototypes are evolved continually in the same latent space, enabling
  learning and prediction at any point. To continually adapt the prototypes without
  keeping any prior task data, we propose a novel distillation loss that constrains
  class prototypes to maintain relative similarities as compared to new task data.
  This method yields state-of-the-art performance in the task-incremental setting,
  outperforming methods relying on large amounts of data, and provides strong performance
  in the class-incremental setting without using any stored data points.
