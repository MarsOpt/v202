title: Automatically marginalized MCMC in probabilistic programming
openreview: 19rjmepYx3
abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful algorithm to sample latent variables
  from Bayesian models. The advent of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) frees
  users from writing inference algorithms and lets users focus on modeling. However,
  many models are difficult for HMC to solve directly, and often require tricks like
  model reparameterization. We are motivated by the fact that many of those models
  could be simplified by marginalization. We propose to use automatic marginalization
  as part of the sampling process using HMC in a graphical model extracted from a
  PPL, which substantially improves sampling from real-world hierarchical models.
