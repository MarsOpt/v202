title: 'CO-BED: Information-Theoretic Contextual Optimization via Bayesian Experimental
  Design'
openreview: 2ooUXQQCPJ
abstract: We formalize the problem of contextual optimization through the lens of
  Bayesian experimental design and propose CO-BEDâ€”a general, model-agnostic framework
  for designing contextual experiments using information-theoretic principles. After
  formulating a suitable information-based objective, we employ black-box variational
  methods to simultaneously estimate it and optimize the designs in a single stochastic
  gradient scheme. In addition, to accommodate discrete actions within our framework,
  we propose leveraging continuous relaxation schemes, which can naturally be integrated
  into our variational objective. As a result, CO-BED provides a general and automated
  solution to a wide range of contextual optimization problems. We illustrate its
  effectiveness in a number of experiments, where CO-BED demonstrates competitive
  performance even when compared to bespoke, model-specific alternatives.
