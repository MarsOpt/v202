title: Local Vertex Colouring Graph Neural Networks
openreview: szL4HN4hkH
abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research focused
  on expanding the expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) beyond the Weisfeiler-Lehman
  (1-WL) framework. While many of these studies have yielded advancements in expressivity,
  they have frequently come at the expense of decreased efficiency or have been restricted
  to specific types of graphs. In this study, we investigate the expressivity of GNNs
  from the perspective of graph search. Specifically, we propose a new vertex colouring
  scheme and demonstrate that classical search algorithms can efficiently compute
  graph representations that extend beyond the 1-WL. We show the colouring scheme
  inherits useful properties from graph search that can help solve problems like graph
  biconnectivity. Furthermore, we show that under certain conditions, the expressivity
  of GNNs increases hierarchically with the radius of the search neighbourhood. To
  further investigate the proposed scheme, we develop a new type of GNN based on two
  search strategies, breadth-first search and depth-first search, highlighting the
  graph properties they can capture on top of 1-WL. Our code is available at https://github.com/seanli3/lvc.
