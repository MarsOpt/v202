title: Tensor Gaussian Process with Contraction for Multi-Channel Imaging Analysis
openreview: HvAFJsXPN9
abstract: Multi-channel imaging data is a prevalent data format in scientific fields
  such as astronomy and biology. The structured information and the high dimensionality
  of these 3-D tensor data makes the analysis an intriguing but challenging topic
  for statisticians and practitioners. The low-rank scalar-on-tensor regression model,
  in particular, has received widespread attention and has been re-formulated as a
  tensor Gaussian Process (Tensor-GP) model with multi-linear kernel in Yu et al.
  (2018). In this paper, we extend the Tensor-GP model by introducing an integrative
  dimensionality reduction technique, called tensor contraction, with a Tensor-GP
  for a scalar-on-tensor regression task with multi-channel imaging data. This is
  motivated by the solar flare forecasting problem with high dimensional multi-channel
  imaging data. We first estimate a latent, reduced-size tensor for each data tensor
  and then apply a multi-linear Tensor-GP on the latent tensor data for prediction.
  We introduce an anisotropic total-variation regularization when conducting the tensor
  contraction to obtain a sparse and smooth latent tensor. We then propose an alternating
  proximal gradient descent algorithm for estimation. We validate our approach via
  extensive simulation studies and applying it to the solar flare forecasting problem.
