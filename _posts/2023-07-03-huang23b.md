title: 'Composer: Creative and Controllable Image Synthesis with Composable Conditions'
openreview: 23Bmw3B1xJ
abstract: Recent large-scale generative models learned on big data are capable of
  synthesizing incredible images yet suffer from limited controllability. This work
  offers a new generation paradigm that allows flexible control of the output image,
  such as spatial layout and palette, while maintaining the synthesis quality and
  model creativity. With compositionality as the core idea, we first decompose an
  image into representative factors, and then train a diffusion model with all these
  factors as the conditions to recompose the input. At the inference stage, the rich
  intermediate representations work as composable elements, leading to a huge design
  space (i.e., exponentially proportional to the number of decomposed factors) for
  customizable content creation. It is noteworthy that our approach, which we call
  Composer, supports various levels of conditions, such as text description as the
  global information, depth map and sketch as the local guidance, color histogram
  for low-level details, etc. Besides improving controllability, we confirm that Composer
  serves as a general framework and facilitates a wide range of classical generative
  tasks without retraining. Code and models will be made available.
