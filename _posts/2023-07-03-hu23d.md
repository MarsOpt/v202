title: Blockwise Stochastic Variance-Reduced Methods with Parallel Speedup for Multi-Block
  Bilevel Optimization
openreview: JeEnuF0zm1
abstract: 'In this paper, we consider non-convex multi-block bilevel optimization
  (MBBO) problems, which involve $m\gg 1$ lower level problems and have important
  applications in machine learning. Designing a stochastic gradient and controlling
  its variance is more intricate due to the hierarchical sampling of blocks and data
  and the unique challenge of estimating hyper-gradient. We aim to achieve three nice
  properties for our algorithm: (a) matching the state-of-the-art complexity of standard
  BO problems with a single block; (b) achieving parallel speedup by sampling $I$
  blocks and sampling $B$ samples for each sampled block per-iteration; (c) avoiding
  the computation of the inverse of a high-dimensional Hessian matrix estimator. However,
  it is non-trivial to achieve all of these by observing that existing works only
  achieve one or two of these properties. To address the involved challenges for achieving
  (a, b, c), we propose two stochastic algorithms by using advanced blockwise variance-reduction
  techniques for tracking the Hessian matrices (for low-dimensional problems) or the
  Hessian-vector products (for high-dimensional problems), and prove an iteration
  complexity of $O(\frac{m\epsilon^{-3}\mathbb{I}(I \textless m)}{I\sqrt{I}}+\frac{m\epsilon^{-3}}{I\sqrt{B}})$
  for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point under appropriate conditions. We also
  conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms comparing
  with existing MBBO algorithms.'
