title: Private Statistical Estimation of Many Quantiles
openreview: QonHFXBbUr
abstract: This work studies the estimation of many statistical quantiles under differential
  privacy. More precisely, given a distribution and access to i.i.d. samples from
  it, we study the estimation of the inverse of its cumulative distribution function
  (the quantile function) at specific points. For instance, this task is of key importance
  in private data generation. We present two different approaches. The first one consists
  in privately estimating the empirical quantiles of the samples and using this result
  as an estimator of the quantiles of the distribution. In particular, we study the
  statistical properties of the recently published algorithm introduced by (Kaplan
  et al., 2022) that privately estimates the quantiles recursively. The second approach
  is to use techniques of density estimation in order to uniformly estimate the quantile
  function on an interval. In particular, we show that there is a tradeoff between
  the two methods. When we want to estimate many quantiles, it is better to estimate
  the density rather than estimating the quantile function at specific points.
