title: 'CoDi: Co-evolving Contrastive Diffusion Models for Mixed-type Tabular Synthesis'
openreview: sy9oDku9Lu
abstract: With growing attention to tabular data these days, the attempt to apply
  a synthetic table to various tasks has been expanded toward various scenarios. Owing
  to the recent advances in generative modeling, fake data generated by tabular data
  synthesis models become sophisticated and realistic. However, there still exists
  a difficulty in modeling discrete variables (columns) of tabular data. In this work,
  we propose to process continuous and discrete variables separately (but being conditioned
  on each other) by two diffusion models. The two diffusion models are co-evolved
  during training by reading conditions from each other. In order to further bind
  the diffusion models, moreover, we introduce a contrastive learning method with
  a negative sampling method. In our experiments with 11 real-world tabular datasets
  and 8 baseline methods, we prove the efficacy of the proposed method, called $\texttt{CoDi}$.
