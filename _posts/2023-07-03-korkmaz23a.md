title: Detecting Adversarial Directions in Deep Reinforcement Learning to Make Robust
  Decisions
openreview: JS2iSqVZlN
abstract: Learning in MDPs with highly complex state representations is currently
  possible due to multiple advancements in reinforcement learning algorithm design.
  However, this incline in complexity, and furthermore the increase in the dimensions
  of the observation came at the cost of volatility that can be taken advantage of
  via adversarial attacks (i.e. moving along worst-case directions in the observation
  space). To solve this policy instability problem we propose a novel method to detect
  the presence of these non-robust directions via local quadratic approximation of
  the deep neural policy loss. Our method provides a theoretical basis for the fundamental
  cut-off between safe observations and adversarial observations. Furthermore, our
  technique is computationally efficient, and does not depend on the methods used
  to produce the worst-case directions. We conduct extensive experiments in the Arcade
  Learning Environment with several different adversarial attack techniques. Most
  significantly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach even in the setting
  where non-robust directions are explicitly optimized to circumvent our proposed
  method.
