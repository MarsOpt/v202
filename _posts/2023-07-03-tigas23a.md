title: Differentiable Multi-Target Causal Bayesian Experimental Design
openreview: oR2IsISm1X
abstract: We introduce a gradient-based approach for the problem of Bayesian optimal
  experimental design to learn causal models in a batch setting â€” a critical component
  for causal discovery from finite data where interventions can be costly or risky.
  Existing methods rely on greedy approximations to construct a batch of experiments
  while using black-box methods to optimize over a <em>single target-state</em> pair
  to intervene with. In this work, we completely dispose of the black-box optimization
  techniques and greedy heuristics and instead propose a conceptually simple end-to-end
  gradient-based optimization procedure to acquire a set of optimal intervention target-value
  pairs. Such a procedure enables parameterization of the design space to efficiently
  optimize over a batch of <em>multi-target-state</em> interventions, a setting which
  has hitherto not been explored due to its complexity. We demonstrate that our proposed
  method outperforms baselines and existing acquisition strategies in both single-target
  and multi-target settings across a number of synthetic datasets.
