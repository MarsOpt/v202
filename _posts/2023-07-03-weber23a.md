title: Global optimality for Euclidean CCCP under Riemannian convexity
openreview: qKralclxZY
abstract: We study geodesically convex (g-convex) problems that can be written as
  a difference of Euclidean convex functions. This structure arises in key applications
  such as matrix scaling, M- estimators of scatter matrices, and Brascamp-Lieb inequalities.
  In particular, we exploit this structure to make use of the Convex-Concave Procedure
  (CCCP), which helps us bypass potentially expensive Riemannian operations and leads
  to very competitive solvers. Importantly, unlike existing theory for CCCP that ensures
  convergence to stationary points, we exploit the overall g-convexity structure and
  provide iteration complexity results for global optimality. We illustrate our results
  by specializing them to a few concrete optimization problems that have been previously
  studied in the machine learning literature. We hope our work spurs the study of
  mixed Euclidean-Riemannian optimization algorithms.
