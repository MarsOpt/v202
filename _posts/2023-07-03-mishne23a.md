title: The Numerical Stability of Hyperbolic Representation Learning
openreview: grhjD5an7A
abstract: The hyperbolic space is widely used for representing hierarchical datasets
  due to its ability to embed trees with small distortion. However, this property
  comes at a price of numerical instability such that training hyperbolic learning
  models will sometimes lead to catastrophic NaN problems, encountering unrepresentable
  values in floating point arithmetic. In this work, we analyze the limitations of
  two popular models for the hyperbolic space, namely, the Poincaré ball and the Lorentz
  model. We find that, under the 64-bit arithmetic system, the Poincaré ball has a
  relatively larger capacity than the Lorentz model for correctly representing points.
  However, the Lorentz model is superior to the Poincaré ball from the perspective
  of optimization, which we theoretically validate. To address these limitations,
  we identify one Euclidean parametrization of the hyperbolic space which can alleviate
  these issues. We further extend this Euclidean parametrization to hyperbolic hyperplanes
  and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the performance of hyperbolic SVM.
