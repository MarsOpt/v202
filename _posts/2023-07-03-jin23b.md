title: Thompson Sampling with Less Exploration is Fast and Optimal
openreview: LxX6l3I6iN
abstract: We propose $\epsilon$-Exploring Thompson Sampling ($\epsilon$-TS), a modified
  version of the Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm for multi-armed bandits. In $\epsilon$-TS,
  arms are selected greedily based on empirical mean rewards with probability $1-\epsilon$,
  and based on posterior samples obtained from TS with probability $\epsilon$. Here,
  $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ is a user-defined constant. By reducing exploration, $\epsilon$-TS
  improves computational efficiency compared to TS while achieving better regret bounds.
  We establish that $\epsilon$-TS is both minimax optimal and asymptotically optimal
  for various popular reward distributions, including Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson,
  and Gamma. A key technical advancement in our analysis is the relaxation of the
  requirement for a stringent anti-concentration bound of the posterior distribution,
  which was necessary in recent analyses that achieved similar bounds. As a result,
  $\epsilon$-TS maintains the posterior update structure of TS while minimizing alterations,
  such as clipping the sampling distribution or solving the inverse of the Kullback-Leibler
  (KL) divergence between reward distributions, as done in previous work. Furthermore,
  our algorithm is as easy to implement as TS, but operates significantly faster due
  to reduced exploration. Empirical evaluations confirm the efficiency and optimality
  of $\epsilon$-TS.
