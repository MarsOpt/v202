title: Disentangled Generative Models for Robust Prediction of System Dynamics
openreview: PePBaTdFhc
abstract: The use of deep neural networks for modelling system dynamics is increasingly
  popular, but long-term prediction accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization
  still present challenges. In this study, we address these challenges by considering
  the parameters of dynamical systems as factors of variation of the data and leverage
  their ground-truth values to disentangle the representations learned by generative
  models. Our experimental results in phase-space and observation-space dynamics,
  demonstrate the effectiveness of latent-space supervision in producing disentangled
  representations, leading to improved long-term prediction accuracy and out-of-distribution
  robustness.
