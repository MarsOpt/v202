title: On Kinetic Optimal Probability Paths for Generative Models
openreview: VWkHEQasPA
abstract: 'Recent successful generative models are trained by fitting a neural network
  to an a-priori defined tractable probability density path taking noise to training
  examples. In this paper we investigate the space of Gaussian probability paths,
  which includes diffusion paths as an instance, and look for an optimal member in
  some useful sense. In particular, minimizing the Kinetic Energy (KE) of a path is
  known to make particlesâ€™ trajectories simple, hence easier to sample, and empirically
  improve performance in terms of likelihood of unseen data and sample generation
  quality. We investigate Kinetic Optimal (KO) Gaussian paths and offer the following
  observations: (i) We show the KE takes a simplified form on the space of Gaussian
  paths, where the data is incorporated only through a single, one dimensional scalar
  function, called the <em>data separation function</em>. (ii) We characterize the
  KO solutions with a one dimensional ODE. (iii) We approximate data-dependent KO
  paths by approximating the data separation function and minimizing the KE. (iv)
  We prove that the data separation function converges to $1$ in the general case
  of arbitrary normalized dataset consisting of $n$ samples in $d$ dimension as $n/\sqrt{d}\rightarrow
  0$. A consequence of this result is that the Conditional Optimal Transport (Cond-OT)
  path becomes <em>kinetic optimal</em> as $n/\sqrt{d}\rightarrow 0$. We further support
  this theory with empirical experiments on ImageNet.'
