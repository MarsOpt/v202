title: 'HOPE: High-order Graph ODE For Modeling Interacting Dynamics'
openreview: 9iChKP4k32
abstract: Leading graph ordinary differential equation (ODE) models have offered generalized
  strategies to model interacting multi-agent dynamical systems in a data-driven approach.
  They typically consist of a temporal graph encoder to get the initial states and
  a neural ODE-based generative model to model the evolution of dynamical systems.
  However, existing methods have severe deficiencies in capacity and efficiency due
  to the failure to model high-order correlations in long-term temporal trends. To
  tackle this, in this paper, we propose a novel model named High-order graph ODE
  (HOPE) for learning from dynamic interaction data, which can be naturally represented
  as a graph. It first adopts a twin graph encoder to initialize the latent state
  representations of nodes and edges, which consists of two branches to capture spatio-temporal
  correlations in complementary manners. More importantly, our HOPE utilizes a second-order
  graph ODE function which models the dynamics for both nodes and edges in the latent
  space respectively, which enables efficient learning of long-term dependencies from
  complex dynamical systems. Experiment results on a variety of datasets demonstrate
  both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.
