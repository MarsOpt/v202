title: 'GLOBE-CE: A Translation Based Approach for Global Counterfactual Explanations'
openreview: KHqQwzx2H2
abstract: Counterfactual explanations have been widely studied in explainability,
  with a range of application dependent methods prominent in fairness, recourse and
  model understanding. The major shortcoming associated with these methods, however,
  is their inability to provide explanations beyond the local or instance-level. While
  many works touch upon the notion of a global explanation, typically suggesting to
  aggregate masses of local explanations in the hope of ascertaining global properties,
  few provide frameworks that are both reliable and computationally tractable. Meanwhile,
  practitioners are requesting more efficient and interactive explainability tools.
  We take this opportunity to propose Global & Efficient Counterfactual Explanations
  (GLOBE-CE), a flexible framework that tackles the reliability and scalability issues
  associated with current state-of-the-art, particularly on higher dimensional datasets
  and in the presence of continuous features. Furthermore, we provide a unique mathematical
  analysis of categorical feature translations, utilising it in our method. Experimental
  evaluation with publicly available datasets and user studies demonstrate that GLOBE-CE
  performs significantly better than the current state-of-the-art across multiple
  metrics (e.g., speed, reliability).
