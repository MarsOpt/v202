title: Controlling Posterior Collapse by an Inverse Lipschitz Constraint on the Decoder
  Network
openreview: BLcLrAFuyS
abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are one of the deep generative models that
  have experienced enormous success over the past decades. However, in practice, they
  suffer from a problem called posterior collapse, which occurs when the posterior
  distribution coincides, or collapses, with the prior taking no information from
  the latent structure of the input data into consideration. In this work, we introduce
  an inverse Lipschitz neural network into the decoder and, based on this architecture,
  provide a new method that can control in a simple and clear manner the degree of
  posterior collapse for a wide range of VAE models equipped with a concrete theoretical
  guarantee. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our method through several numerical
  experiments.
