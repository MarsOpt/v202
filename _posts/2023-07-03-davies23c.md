title: 'The Persistent Laplacian for Data Science: Evaluating Higher-Order Persistent
  Spectral Representations of Data'
openreview: UeCasRZMj5
abstract: Persistent homology is arguably the most successful technique in Topological
  Data Analysis. It combines homology, a topological feature of a data set, with persistence,
  which tracks the evolution of homology over different scales. The persistent Laplacian
  is a recent theoretical development that combines persistence with the combinatorial
  Laplacian, the higher-order extension of the well-known graph Laplacian. Crucially,
  the Laplacian encode both the homology of a data set, and some additional geometric
  information not captured by the homology. Here, we provide the first investigation
  into the efficacy of the persistence Laplacian as an embedding of data for downstream
  classification and regression tasks. We extend the persistent Laplacian to cubical
  complexes so it can be used on images, then evaluate its performance as an embedding
  method on the MNIST and MoleculeNet datasets, demonstrating that it consistently
  outperforms persistent homology across tasks.
