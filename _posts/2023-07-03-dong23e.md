title: 'PASTA: Pessimistic Assortment Optimization'
openreview: Yzfg7JhPhp
abstract: We consider a fundamental class of assortment optimization problems in an
  offline data-driven setting. The firm does not know the underlying customer choice
  model but has access to an offline dataset consisting of the historically offered
  assortment set, customer choice, and revenue. The objective is to use the offline
  dataset to find an optimal assortment. Due to the combinatorial nature of assortment
  optimization, the problem of insufficient data coverage is likely to occur in the
  offline dataset. Therefore, designing a provably efficient offline learning algorithm
  becomes a significant challenge. To this end, based on the principle of pessimism,
  we propose a novel algorithm called Pessimistic ASsortment opTimizAtion (PASTA for
  short), which can correctly identify the optimal assortment by only requiring the
  offline data to cover the optimal assortment under general settings. In particular,
  we establish the first regret bound for the offline assortment optimization problem
  under the celebrated multinomial logit model (MNL). We also propose an efficient
  computational procedure to solve our pessimistic assortment optimization problem.
  Our numerical studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the
  existing baseline method.
