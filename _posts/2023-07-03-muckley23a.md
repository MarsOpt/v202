title: Improving Statistical Fidelity for Neural Image Compression with Implicit Local
  Likelihood Models
openreview: iUspLfxpWC
abstract: Lossy image compression aims to represent images in as few bits as possible
  while maintaining fidelity to the original. Theoretical results indicate that optimizing
  distortion metrics such as PSNR or MS-SSIM necessarily leads to a discrepancy in
  the statistics of original images from those of reconstructions, in particular at
  low bitrates, often manifested by the blurring of the compressed images. Previous
  work has leveraged adversarial discriminators to improve statistical fidelity. Yet
  these binary discriminators adopted from generative modeling tasks may not be ideal
  for image compression. In this paper, we introduce a non-binary discriminator that
  is conditioned on quantized local image representations obtained via VQ-VAE autoencoders.
  Our evaluations on the CLIC2020, DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our discriminator
  is more effective for jointly optimizing distortion (e.g., PSNR) and statistical
  fidelity (e.g., FID) than the PatchGAN of the state-of-the-art HiFiC model. On CLIC2020,
  we obtain the same FID as HiFiC with 30-40% fewer bits.
