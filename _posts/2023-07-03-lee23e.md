title: Conditional Graph Information Bottleneck for Molecular Relational Learning
openreview: 5hz3GV4lPq
abstract: Molecular relational learning, whose goal is to learn the interaction behavior
  between molecular pairs, got a surge of interest in molecular sciences due to its
  wide range of applications. Recently, graph neural networks have recently shown
  great success in molecular relational learning by modeling a molecule as a graph
  structure, and considering atom-level interactions between two molecules. Despite
  their success, existing molecular relational learning methods tend to overlook the
  nature of chemistry, i.e., a chemical compound is composed of multiple substructures
  such as functional groups that cause distinctive chemical reactions. In this work,
  we propose a novel relational learning framework, called CGIB, that predicts the
  interaction behavior between a pair of graphs by detecting core subgraphs therein.
  The main idea is, given a pair of graphs, to find a subgraph from a graph that contains
  the minimal sufficient information regarding the task at hand conditioned on the
  paired graph based on the principle of conditional graph information bottleneck.
  We argue that our proposed method mimics the nature of chemical reactions, i.e.,
  the core substructure of a molecule varies depending on which other molecule it
  interacts with. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world datasets
  demonstrate the superiority of CGIB over state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is
  available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/CGIB.
