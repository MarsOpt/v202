title: Rethinking Explaining Graph Neural Networks via Non-parametric Subgraph Matching
openreview: MocsSAUKlk
abstract: 'The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) provokes the question about
  explainability: “Which fraction of the input graph is the most determinant of the
  prediction?” Particularly, parametric explainers prevail in existing approaches
  because of their more robust capability to decipher the black-box (i.e., target
  GNNs). In this paper, based on the observation that graphs typically share some
  common motif patterns, we propose a novel non-parametric subgraph matching framework,
  dubbed MatchExplainer, to explore explanatory subgraphs. It couples the target graph
  with other counterpart instances and identifies the most crucial joint substructure
  by minimizing the node corresponding-based distance. Moreover, we note that present
  graph sampling or node-dropping methods usually suffer from the false positive sampling
  problem. To alleviate this issue, we design a new augmentation paradigm named MatchDrop.
  It takes advantage of MatchExplainer to fix the most informative portion of the
  graph and merely operates graph augmentations on the rest less informative part.
  Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness
  of our MatchExplainer by outperforming all state-of-the-art parametric baselines
  with significant margins. Results also demonstrate that MatchDrop is a general scheme
  to be equipped with GNNs for enhanced performance. The code is available at https://github.com/smiles724/MatchExplainer.'
