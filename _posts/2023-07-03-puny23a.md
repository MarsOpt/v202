title: Equivariant Polynomials for Graph Neural Networks
openreview: oVwFwXO9Kg
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are inherently limited in their expressive power.
  Recent seminal works (Xu et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2019b) introduced the Weisfeiler-Lehman
  (WL) hierarchy as a measure of expressive power. Although this hierarchy has propelled
  significant advances in GNN analysis and architecture developments, it suffers from
  several significant limitations. These include a complex definition that lacks direct
  guidance for model improvement and a WL hierarchy that is too coarse to study current
  GNNs. This paper introduces an alternative expressive power hierarchy based on the
  ability of GNNs to calculate equivariant polynomials of a certain degree. As a first
  step, we provide a full characterization of all equivariant graph polynomials by
  introducing a concrete basis, significantly generalizing previous results. Each
  basis element corresponds to a specific multi-graph, and its computation over some
  graph data input corresponds to a tensor contraction problem. Second, we propose
  algorithmic tools for evaluating the expressiveness of GNNs using tensor contraction
  sequences, and calculate the expressive power of popular GNNs. Finally, we enhance
  the expressivity of common GNN architectures by adding polynomial features or additional
  operations / aggregations inspired by our theory. These enhanced GNNs demonstrate
  state-of-the-art results in experiments across multiple graph learning benchmarks.
