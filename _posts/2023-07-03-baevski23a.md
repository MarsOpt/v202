title: Efficient Self-supervised Learning with Contextualized Target Representations
  for Vision, Speech and Language
openreview: Jc5QwxfyyQ
abstract: Current self-supervised learning algorithms are often modality-specific
  and require large amounts of computational resources. To address these issues, we
  increase the training efficiency of data2vec, a learning objective that generalizes
  across several modalities. We do not encode masked tokens, use a fast convolutional
  decoder and amortize the effort to build teacher representations. data2vec 2.0 benefits
  from the rich contextualized target representations introduced in data2vec which
  enable a fast self-supervised learner. Experiments on ImageNet-1K image classification
  show that data2vec 2.0 matches the accuracy of Masked Autoencoders in 16.4x lower
  pre-training time, on Librispeech speech recognition it performs as well as wav2vec
  2.0 in 10.6x less time, and on GLUE natural language understanding it matches a
  retrained RoBERTa model in half the time. Trading some speed for accuracy results
  in ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy of 86.8% with a ViT-L model trained for 150 epochs.
