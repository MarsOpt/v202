title: Transformed Distribution Matching for Missing Value Imputation
openreview: WBWb1FU8iz
abstract: We study the problem of imputing missing values in a dataset, which has
  important applications in many domains. The key to missing value imputation is to
  capture the data distribution with incomplete samples and impute the missing values
  accordingly. In this paper, by leveraging the fact that any two batches of data
  with missing values come from the same data distribution, we propose to impute the
  missing values of two batches of samples by transforming them into a latent space
  through deep invertible functions and matching them distributionally. To learn the
  transformations and impute the missing values simultaneously, a simple and well-motivated
  algorithm is proposed. Our algorithm has fewer hyperparameters to fine-tune and
  generates high-quality imputations regardless of how missing values are generated.
  Extensive experiments over a large number of datasets and competing benchmark algorithms
  show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
