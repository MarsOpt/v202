title: 'Blackout Diffusion: Generative Diffusion Models in Discrete-State Spaces'
openreview: lpc5vlfxp8
abstract: Typical generative diffusion models rely on a Gaussian diffusion process
  for training the backward transformations, which can then be used to generate samples
  from Gaussian noise. However, real world data often takes place in discrete-state
  spaces, including many scientific applications. Here, we develop a theoretical formulation
  for arbitrary discrete-state Markov processes in the forward diffusion process using
  exact (as opposed to variational) analysis. We relate the theory to the existing
  continuous-state Gaussian diffusion as well as other approaches to discrete diffusion,
  and identify the corresponding reverse-time stochastic process and score function
  in the continuous-time setting, and the reverse-time mapping in the discrete-time
  setting. As an example of this framework, we introduce “Blackout Diffusion”, which
  learns to produce samples from an empty image instead of from noise. Numerical experiments
  on the CIFAR-10, Binarized MNIST, and CelebA datasets confirm the feasibility of
  our approach. Generalizing from specific (Gaussian) forward processes to discrete-state
  processes without a variational approximation sheds light on how to interpret diffusion
  models, which we discuss.
