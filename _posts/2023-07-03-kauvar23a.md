title: Curious Replay for Model-based Adaptation
openreview: 7p7YakZP2H
abstract: Agents must be able to adapt quickly as an environment changes. We find
  that existing model-based reinforcement learning agents are unable to do this well,
  in part because of how they use past experiences to train their world model. Here,
  we present Curious Replayâ€”a form of prioritized experience replay tailored to model-based
  agents through use of a curiosity-based priority signal. Agents using Curious Replay
  exhibit improved performance in an exploration paradigm inspired by animal behavior
  and on the Crafter benchmark. DreamerV3 with Curious Replay surpasses state-of-the-art
  performance on Crafter, achieving a mean score of 19.4 that substantially improves
  on the previous high score of 14.5 by DreamerV3 with uniform replay, while also
  maintaining similar performance on the Deepmind Control Suite. Code for Curious
  Replay is available at github.com/AutonomousAgentsLab/curiousreplay.
