title: Optimal Sets and Solution Paths of ReLU Networks
openreview: Th1vXHbzZ6
abstract: We develop an analytical framework to characterize the set of optimal ReLU
  neural networks by reformulating the non-convex training problem as a convex program.
  We show that the global optima of the convex parameterization are given by a polyhedral
  set and then extend this characterization to the optimal set of the non-convex training
  objective. Since all stationary points of the ReLU training problem can be represented
  as optima of sub-sampled convex programs, our work provide a general expression
  for all critical points of the non-convex objective. We then leverage our results
  to provide an optimal pruning algorithm for computing minimal networks, establish
  conditions for the regularization path of ReLU networks to be continuous, and develop
  sensitivity results for minimal ReLU networks.
