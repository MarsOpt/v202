title: Discover-Then-Rank Unlabeled Support Vectors in the Dual Space for Multi-Class
  Active Learning
openreview: jsPzZ4Q6ne
abstract: We propose to approach active learning (AL) from a novel perspective of
  discovering and then ranking potential support vectors by leveraging the key properties
  of the dual space of a sparse kernel max-margin predictor. We theoretically analyze
  the change of a hinge loss in the dual form and provide both the upper and lower
  bounds that are deeply connected to the key geometric properties induced by the
  dual space, which then help us identify various types of important data samples
  for AL. These bounds inform the design of a novel sampling strategy that leverages
  class-wise evidence as a key vehicle, formed through an affine combination of dual
  variables and kernel evaluation. We construct two distinct types of sampling functions,
  including discovery and ranking. The former focuses on samples with low total evidence
  from all classes, which signifies their potential to support exploration; the latter
  exploits the current decision boundary to identify the most conflicting regions
  for sampling, aiming to further refine the decision boundary. These two functions,
  which are complementary to each other, are automatically arranged into a two-phase
  active sampling process that starts with the discovery and then transitions to the
  ranking of data points to most effectively balance exploration and exploitation.
  Experiments on various real-world data demonstrate the state-of-the-art AL performance
  achieved by our model.
