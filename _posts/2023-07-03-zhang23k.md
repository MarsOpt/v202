title: A Complete Expressiveness Hierarchy for Subgraph GNNs via Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman
  Tests
openreview: 2Hp7U3k5Ph
abstract: Recently, subgraph GNNs have emerged as an important direction for developing
  expressive graph neural networks (GNNs). While numerous architectures have been
  proposed, so far there is still a limited understanding of how various design paradigms
  differ in terms of expressive power, nor is it clear what design principle achieves
  maximal expressiveness with minimal architectural complexity. To address these fundamental
  questions, this paper conducts a systematic study of general node-based subgraph
  GNNs through the lens of Subgraph Weisfeiler-Lehman Tests (SWL). Our central result
  is to build a complete hierarchy of SWL with strictly growing expressivity. Concretely,
  we prove that any node-based subgraph GNN falls into one of the six SWL equivalence
  classes, among which $\mathsf{SSWL}$ achieves the maximal expressive power. We also
  study how these equivalence classes differ in terms of their practical expressiveness
  such as encoding graph distance and biconnectivity. In addition, we give a tight
  expressivity upper bound of all SWL algorithms by establishing a close relation
  with localized versions of WL and Folklore WL (FWL) tests. Overall, our results
  provide insights into the power of existing subgraph GNNs, guide the design of new
  architectures, and point out their limitations by revealing an inherent gap with
  the 2-FWL test. Finally, experiments demonstrate that $\mathsf{SSWL}$-inspired subgraph
  GNNs can significantly outperform prior architectures on multiple benchmarks despite
  great simplicity.
