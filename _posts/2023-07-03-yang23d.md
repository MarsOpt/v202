title: 'Weighted Flow Diffusion for Local Graph Clustering with Node Attributes: an
  Algorithm and Statistical Guarantees'
openreview: 6rlGbYv4bT
abstract: Local graph clustering methods aim to detect small clusters in very large
  graphs without the need to process the whole graph. They are fundamental and scalable
  tools for a wide range of tasks such as local community detection, node ranking
  and node embedding. While prior work on local graph clustering mainly focuses on
  graphs without node attributes, modern real-world graph datasets typically come
  with node attributes that provide valuable additional information. We present a
  simple local graph clustering algorithm for graphs with node attributes, based on
  the idea of diffusing mass locally in the graph while accounting for both structural
  and attribute proximities. Using high-dimensional concentration results, we provide
  statistical guarantees on the performance of the algorithm for the recovery of a
  target cluster with a single seed node. We give conditions under which a target
  cluster generated from a fairly general contextual random graph model, which includes
  both the stochastic block model and the planted cluster model as special cases,
  can be fully recovered with bounded false positives. Empirically, we validate all
  theoretical claims using synthetic data, and we show that incorporating node attributes
  leads to superior local clustering performances using real-world graph datasets.
