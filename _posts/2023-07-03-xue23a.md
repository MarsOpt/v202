title: Near-Optimal Quantum Coreset Construction Algorithms for Clustering
openreview: t4CrIEyukh
abstract: "$k$-Clustering in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ (e.g., $k$-median and $k$-means) is a
  fundamental machine learning problem. While near-linear time approximation algorithms
  were known in the classical setting for a dataset with cardinality $n$, it remains
  open to find sublinear-time quantum algorithms. We give quantum algorithms that
  find coresets for $k$-clustering in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{nk}d^{3/2})$
  query complexity. Our coreset reduces the input size from $n$ to $\\mathrm{poly}(k\\epsilon^{-1}d)$,
  so that existing $\\alpha$-approximation algorithms for clustering can run on top
  of it and yield $(1 + \\epsilon)\\alpha$-approximation. This eventually yields a
  quadratic speedup for various $k$-clustering approximation algorithms. We complement
  our algorithm with a nearly matching lower bound, that any quantum algorithm must
  make $\\Omega(\\sqrt{nk})$ queries in order to achieve even $O(1)$-approximation
  for $k$-clustering."
