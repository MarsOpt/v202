title: Regularizing Towards Soft Equivariance Under Mixed Symmetries
openreview: HlpBeHoeUA
abstract: Datasets often have their intrinsic symmetries, and particular deep-learning
  models called equivariant or invariant models have been developed to exploit these
  symmetries. However, if some or all of these symmetries are only approximate, which
  frequently happens in practice, these models may be suboptimal due to the architectural
  restrictions imposed on them. We tackle this issue of approximate symmetries in
  a setup where symmetries are mixed, i.e., they are symmetries of not single but
  multiple different types and the degree of approximation varies across these types.
  Instead of proposing a new architectural restriction as in most of the previous
  approaches, we present a regularizer-based method for building a model for a dataset
  with mixed approximate symmetries. The key component of our method is what we call
  equivariance regularizer for a given type of symmetries, which measures how much
  a model is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the type. Our method is
  trained with these regularizers, one per each symmetry type, and the strength of
  the regularizers is automatically tuned during training, leading to the discovery
  of the approximation levels of some candidate symmetry types without explicit supervision.
  Using synthetic function approximation and motion forecasting tasks, we demonstrate
  that our method achieves better accuracy than prior approaches while discovering
  the approximate symmetry levels correctly.
