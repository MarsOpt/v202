title: Uncertainty Estimation by Fisher Information-based Evidential Deep Learning
openreview: kbbpaKhXmN
abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a key factor that makes deep learning reliable
  in practical applications. Recently proposed evidential neural networks explicitly
  account for different uncertainties by treating the networkâ€™s outputs as evidence
  to parameterize the Dirichlet distribution, and achieve impressive performance in
  uncertainty estimation. However, for high data uncertainty samples but annotated
  with the one-hot label, the evidence-learning process for those mislabeled classes
  is over-penalized and remains hindered. To address this problem, we propose a novel
  method, Fisher Information-based Evidential Deep Learning ($\mathcal{I}$-EDL). In
  particular, we introduce Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to measure the informativeness
  of evidence carried by each sample, according to which we can dynamically reweight
  the objective loss terms to make the network more focus on the representation learning
  of uncertain classes. The generalization ability of our network is further improved
  by optimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound. As demonstrated empirically, our proposed
  method consistently outperforms traditional EDL-related algorithms in multiple uncertainty
  estimation tasks, especially in the more challenging few-shot classification settings.
