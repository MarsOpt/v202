title: Generated Graph Detection
openreview: OoTa4H6Bnz
abstract: Graph generative models become increasingly effective for data distribution
  approximation and data augmentation. While they have aroused public concerns about
  their malicious misuses or misinformation broadcasts, just as what Deepfake visual
  and auditory media has been delivering to society. Hence it is essential to regulate
  the prevalence of generated graphs. To tackle this problem, we pioneer the formulation
  of the generated graph detection problem to distinguish generated graphs from real
  ones. We propose the first framework to systematically investigate a set of sophisticated
  models and their performance in four classification scenarios. Each scenario switches
  between seen and unseen datasets/generators during testing to get closer to real-world
  settings and progressively challenge the classifiers. Extensive experiments evidence
  that all the models are qualified for generated graph detection, with specific models
  having advantages in specific scenarios. Resulting from the validated generality
  and oblivion of the classifiers to unseen datasets/generators, we draw a safe conclusion
  that our solution can sustain for a decent while to curb generated graph misuses.
