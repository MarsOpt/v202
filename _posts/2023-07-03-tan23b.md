title: Provably Invariant Learning without Domain Information
openreview: 0jSSVPrfcX
abstract: Typical machine learning applications always assume the data follows independent
  and identically distributed (IID) assumptions. In contrast, this assumption is frequently
  violated in real-world circumstances, leading to the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization
  problem and a major drop in model robustness. To mitigate this issue, the invariant
  learning technique is leveraged to distinguish between spurious features and invariant
  features among all input features and to train the model purely on the basis of
  the invariant features. Numerous invariant learning strategies imply that the training
  data should contain domain information. Such information includes the environment
  index or auxiliary information acquired from prior knowledge. However, acquiring
  these information is typically impossible in practice. In this study, we present
  TIVA for environment-independent invariance learning, which requires no environment-specific
  information in training data. We discover and prove that, given certain mild data
  conditions, it is possible to train an environment partitioning policy based on
  attributes that are independent of the targets and then conduct invariant risk minimization.
  We examine our method in comparison to other baseline methods, which demonstrate
  superior performance and excellent robustness under OOD, using multiple benchmarks.
