title: Adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference
openreview: O7t2ZqUk7y
abstract: Bayesian inference usually requires running potentially costly inference
  procedures separately for every new observation. In contrast, the idea of amortized
  Bayesian inference is to initially invest computational cost in training an inference
  network on simulated data, which can subsequently be used to rapidly perform inference
  (i.e., to return estimates of posterior distributions) for new observations. This
  approach has been applied to many real-world models in the sciences and engineering,
  but it is unclear how robust the approach is to adversarial perturbations in the
  observed data. Here, we study the adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference,
  focusing on simulation-based estimation of multi-dimensional posterior distributions.
  We show that almost unrecognizable, targeted perturbations of the observations can
  lead to drastic changes in the predicted posterior and highly unrealistic posterior
  predictive samples, across several benchmark tasks and a real-world example from
  neuroscience. We propose a computationally efficient regularization scheme based
  on penalizing the Fisher information of the conditional density estimator, and show
  how it improves the adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference.
