title: Context-Aware Bayesian Network Actor-Critic Methods for Cooperative Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning
openreview: pLQoqbUTue
abstract: Executing actions in a correlated manner is a common strategy for human
  coordination that often leads to better cooperation, which is also potentially beneficial
  for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the recent success
  of MARL relies heavily on the convenient paradigm of purely decentralized execution,
  where there is no action correlation among agents for scalability considerations.
  In this work, we introduce a Bayesian network to inaugurate correlations between
  agentsâ€™ action selections in their joint policy. Theoretically, we establish a theoretical
  justification for why action dependencies are beneficial by deriving the multi-agent
  policy gradient formula under such a Bayesian network joint policy and proving its
  global convergence to Nash equilibria under tabular softmax policy parameterization
  in cooperative Markov games. Further, by equipping existing MARL algorithms with
  a recent method of differentiable directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we develop practical
  algorithms to learn the context-aware Bayesian network policies in scenarios with
  partial observability and various difficulty. We also dynamically decrease the sparsity
  of the learned DAG throughout the training process, which leads to weakly or even
  purely independent policies for decentralized execution. Empirical results on a
  range of MARL benchmarks show the benefits of our approach.
