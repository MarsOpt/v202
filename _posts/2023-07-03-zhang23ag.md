title: Interactive Object Placement with Reinforcement Learning
openreview: hwHBaL7wur
abstract: Object placement aims to insert a foreground object into a background image
  with a suitable location and size to create a natural composition. To predict a
  diverse distribution of placements, existing methods usually establish a one-to-one
  mapping from random vectors to the placements. However, these random vectors are
  not interpretable, which prevents users from interacting with the object placement
  process. To address this problem, we propose an Interactive Object Placement method
  with Reinforcement Learning, dubbed IOPRE, to make sequential decisions for producing
  a reasonable placement given an initial location and size of the foreground. We
  first design a novel action space to flexibly and stably adjust the location and
  size of the foreground while preserving its aspect ratio. Then, we propose a multi-factor
  state representation learning method, which integrates composition image features
  and sinusoidal positional embeddings of the foreground to make decisions for selecting
  actions. Finally, we design a hybrid reward function that combines placement assessment
  and the number of steps to ensure that the agent learns to place objects in the
  most visually pleasing and semantically appropriate location. Experimental results
  on the OPA dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in terms of plausibility and diversity.
