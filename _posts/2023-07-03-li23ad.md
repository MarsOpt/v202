title: Hierarchical Diffusion for Offline Decision Making
openreview: 55kLa7tH9o
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning typically introduces a hierarchical structure
  to solve the long-horizon problem so as to address its thorny issue of variance
  accumulation. Problems of deadly triad, limited data and reward sparsity, however,
  still remain, rendering the design of effective, hierarchical offline RL algorithms
  for general-purpose policy learning a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first
  formulate the problem of offline long-horizon decision-$\mathbf{M}$ak$\mathbf{I}$ng
  from the perspective of conditional generative modeling by incorporating goals into
  the control-as-inference graphic models. A $\mathbf{H}$ierarchical trajectory-level
  $\mathbf{D}$iffusion probabilistic model is then proposed with classifier-free guidance.
  HDMI employs a cascade framework that utilizes the reward-conditional goal diffuser
  for the subgoal discovery and the goal-conditional trajectory diffuser for generating
  the corresponding action sequence of subgoals. Planning-based subgoal extraction
  and transformer-based diffusion are employed to deal with the sub-optimal data pollution
  and long-range subgoal dependencies in the goal diffusion. Numerical experiments
  verify the advantages of HDMI on long-horizon decision-making compared to SOTA offline
  RL methods and conditional generative models.
