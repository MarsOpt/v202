title: Graph Reinforcement Learning for Network Control via Bi-Level Optimization
openreview: rzN05i4GOE
abstract: Optimization problems over dynamic networks have been extensively studied
  and widely used in the past decades to formulate numerous real-world problems. However,
  (1) traditional optimization-based approaches do not scale to large networks, and
  (2) the design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms often requires significant
  manual trial-and-error. In this work, we argue that data-driven strategies can automate
  this process and learn efficient algorithms without compromising optimality. To
  do so, we present network control problems through the lens of reinforcement learning
  and propose a graph network-based framework to handle a broad class of problems.
  Instead of naively computing actions over high-dimensional graph elements, e.g.,
  edges, we propose a bi-level formulation where we (1) specify a desired next state
  via RL, and (2) solve a convex program to best achieve it, leading to drastically
  improved scalability and performance. We further highlight a collection of desirable
  features to system designers, investigate design decisions, and present experiments
  on real-world control problems showing the utility, scalability, and flexibility
  of our framework.
