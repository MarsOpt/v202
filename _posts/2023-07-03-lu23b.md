title: 'Two-Scale Gradient Descent Ascent Dynamics Finds Mixed Nash Equilibria of
  Continuous Games: A Mean-Field Perspective'
openreview: WFwL0dIOVH
abstract: Finding the mixed Nash equilibria (MNE) of a two-player zero sum continuous
  game is an important and challenging problem in machine learning. A canonical algorithm
  to finding the MNE is the noisy gradient descent ascent method which in the infinite
  particle limit gives rise to the Mean-Field Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA) dynamics
  on the space of probability measures. In this paper, we first study the convergence
  of a two-scale Mean-Field GDA dynamics for finding the MNE of the entropy-regularized
  objective. More precisely we show that for each finite temperature (or regularization
  parameter), the two-scale Mean-Field GDA with a suitable finite scale ratio converges
  exponentially to the unique MNE without assuming the convexity or concavity of the
  interaction potential. The key ingredient of our proof lies in the construction
  of new Lyapunov functions that dissipate exponentially along the Mean-Field GDA.
  We further study the simulated annealing of the Mean-Field GDA dynamics. We show
  that with a temperature schedule that decays logarithmically in time the annealed
  Mean-Field GDA converges to the MNE of the original unregularized objective.
