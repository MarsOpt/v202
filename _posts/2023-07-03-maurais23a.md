title: Multi-Fidelity Covariance Estimation in the Log-Euclidean Geometry
openreview: xPU9F90HjM
abstract: We introduce a multi-fidelity estimator of covariance matrices that employs
  the log-Euclidean geometry of the symmetric positive-definite manifold. The estimator
  fuses samples from a hierarchy of data sources of differing fidelities and costs
  for variance reduction while guaranteeing definiteness, in contrast with previous
  approaches. The new estimator makes covariance estimation tractable in applications
  where simulation or data collection is expensive; to that end, we develop an optimal
  sample allocation scheme that minimizes the mean-squared error of the estimator
  given a fixed budget. Guaranteed definiteness is crucial to metric learning, data
  assimilation, and other downstream tasks. Evaluations of our approach using data
  from physical applications (heat conduction, fluid dynamics) demonstrate more accurate
  metric learning and speedups of more than one order of magnitude compared to benchmarks.
