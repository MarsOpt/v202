title: Self-supervised Neural Factor Analysis for Disentangling Utterance-level Speech
  Representations
openreview: SZiwfXqwtW
abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models such as wav2vec and HuBERT
  have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on automatic speech recognition (ASR)
  and proved to be extremely useful in low label-resource settings. However, the success
  of SSL models has yet to transfer to utterance-level tasks such as speaker, emotion,
  and language recognition, which still require supervised fine-tuning of the SSL
  models to obtain good performance. We argue that the problem is caused by the lack
  of disentangled representations and an utterance-level learning objective for these
  tasks. Inspired by how HuBERT uses clustering to discover hidden acoustic units,
  we formulate a factor analysis (FA) model that uses the discovered hidden acoustic
  units to align the SSL features. The underlying utterance-level representations
  are disentangled using probabilistic inference on the aligned features. Furthermore,
  the variational lower bound derived from the FA model provides an utterance-level
  objective, allowing error gradients to be backpropagated to the Transformer layers
  to learn highly discriminative acoustic units. When used in conjunction with HuBERTâ€™s
  masked prediction training, our models outperform the current best model, WavLM,
  on all utterance-level non-semantic tasks on the SUPERB benchmark with only 20%
  of labeled data.
