title: Adaptive Smoothing Gradient Learning for Spiking Neural Networks
openreview: GdkwSGTpbC
abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) with biologically inspired spatio-temporal
  dynamics demonstrate superior energy efficiency on neuromorphic architectures. Error
  backpropagation in SNNs is prohibited by the all-or-none nature of spikes. The existing
  solution circumvents this problem by a relaxation on the gradient calculation using
  a continuous function with a constant relaxation de- gree, so-called surrogate gradient
  learning. Nevertheless, such a solution introduces additional smoothing error on
  spike firing which leads to the gradients being estimated inaccurately. Thus, how
  to adaptively adjust the relaxation degree and eliminate smoothing error progressively
  is crucial. Here, we propose a methodology such that training a prototype neural
  network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation
  degree into the network with random spike noise. In this way, the network learns
  adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs. The theoretical analysis
  further shows optimization on such a noisy network could be evolved into optimization
  on the embedded SNN with shared weights progressively. Moreover, The experiments
  on static images, dynamic event streams, speech, and instrumental sounds show the
  proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets with
  remarkable robustness on different relaxation degrees.
