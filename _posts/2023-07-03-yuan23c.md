title: Automatic Intrinsic Reward Shaping for Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning
openreview: UyJJ1pnb0y
abstract: 'We present AIRS: <b>A</b>utomatic <b>I</b>ntrinsic <b>R</b>eward <b>S</b>haping
  that intelligently and adaptively provides high-quality intrinsic rewards to enhance
  exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, AIRS selects shaping
  function from a predefined set based on the estimated task return in real-time,
  providing reliable exploration incentives and alleviating the biased objective problem.
  Moreover, we develop an intrinsic reward toolkit to provide efficient and reliable
  implementations of diverse intrinsic reward approaches. We test AIRS on various
  tasks of MiniGrid, Procgen, and DeepMind Control Suite. Extensive simulation demonstrates
  that AIRS can outperform the benchmarking schemes and achieve superior performance
  with simple architecture.'
