title: 'Sketch-Flip-Merge: Mergeable Sketches for Private Distinct Counting'
openreview: BAQWKRdL1D
abstract: Data sketching is a critical tool for distinct counting, enabling multisets
  to be represented by compact summaries that admit fast cardinality estimates. Because
  sketches may be merged to summarize multiset unions, they are a basic building block
  in data warehouses. Although many practical sketches for cardinality estimation
  exist, none provide privacy when merging. We propose the first practical cardinality
  sketches that are simultaneously mergeable, differentially private (DP), and have
  low empirical errors. These introduce a novel randomized algorithm for performing
  logical operations on noisy bits, a tight privacy analysis, and provably optimal
  estimation. Our sketches dramatically outperform existing theoretical solutions
  in simulations and on real-world data.
