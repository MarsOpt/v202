title: Mitigating Propagation Failures in Physics-informed Neural Networks using Retain-Resample-Release
  (R3) Sampling
openreview: rhvb4kprWB
abstract: Despite the success of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in approximating
  partial differential equations (PDEs), PINNs can sometimes fail to converge to the
  correct solution in problems involving complicated PDEs. This is reflected in several
  recent studies on characterizing the "failure modes" of PINNs, although a thorough
  understanding of the connection between PINN failure modes and sampling strategies
  is missing. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective of failure modes of PINNs
  by hypothesizing that training PINNs relies on successful "propagation" of solution
  from initial and/or boundary condition points to interior points. We show that PINNs
  with poor sampling strategies can get stuck at trivial solutions if there are propagation
  failures, characterized by highly imbalanced PDE residual fields. To mitigate propagation
  failures, we propose a novel Retain-Resample-Release sampling (R3) algorithm that
  can incrementally accumulate collocation points in regions of high PDE residuals
  with little to no computational overhead. We provide an extension of R3 sampling
  to respect the principle of causality while solving time-dependent PDEs. We theoretically
  analyze the behavior of R3 sampling and empirically demonstrate its efficacy and
  efficiency in comparison with baselines on a variety of PDE problems.
