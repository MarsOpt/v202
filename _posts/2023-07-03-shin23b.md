title: 'MetricGAN-OKD: Multi-Metric Optimization of MetricGAN via Online Knowledge
  Distillation for Speech Enhancement'
openreview: xOWLUSQCE4
abstract: In speech enhancement, MetricGAN-based approaches reduce the discrepancy
  between the $L_p$ loss and evaluation metrics by utilizing a non-differentiable
  evaluation metric as the objective function. However, optimizing multiple metrics
  simultaneously remains challenging owing to the problem of confusing gradient directions.
  In this paper, we propose an effective multi-metric optimization method in MetricGAN
  via online knowledge distillationâ€”MetricGAN-OKD. MetricGAN-OKD, which consists of
  multiple generators and target metrics, related by a one-to-one correspondence,
  enables generators to learn with respect to a single metric reliably while improving
  performance with respect to other metrics by mimicking other generators. Experimental
  results on speech enhancement and listening enhancement tasks reveal that the proposed
  method significantly improves performance in terms of multiple metrics compared
  to existing multi-metric optimization methods. Further, the good performance of
  MetricGAN-OKD is explained in terms of network generalizability and correlation
  between metrics.
