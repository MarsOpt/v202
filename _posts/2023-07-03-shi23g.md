title: Statistical Inference on Multi-armed Bandits with Delayed Feedback
openreview: mlCogIjF0S
abstract: Multi armed bandit (MAB) algorithms have been increasingly used to complement
  or integrate with A/B tests and randomized clinical trials in e-commerce, healthcare,
  and policymaking. Recent developments incorporate possible delayed feedback. While
  existing MAB literature often focuses on maximizing the expected cumulative reward
  outcomes (or, equivalently, regret minimization), few efforts have been devoted
  to establish valid statistical inference approaches to quantify the uncertainty
  of learned policies. We attempt to fill this gap by providing a unified statistical
  inference framework for policy evaluation where a target policy is allowed to differ
  from the data collecting policy, and our framework allows delay to be associated
  with the treatment arms. We present an adaptively weighted estimator that on one
  hand incorporates the arm-dependent delaying mechanism to achieve consistency, and
  on the other hand mitigates the variance inflation across stages due to vanishing
  sampling probability. In particular, our estimator does not critically depend on
  the ability to estimate the unknown delay mechanism. Under appropriate conditions,
  we prove that our estimator converges to a normal distribution as the number of
  time points goes to infinity, which provides guarantees for large-sample statistical
  inference. We illustrate the finite-sample performance of our approach through Monte
  Carlo experiments.
