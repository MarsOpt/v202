title: 'Internet Explorer: Targeted Representation Learning on the Open Web'
openreview: QBUS4OXqvM
abstract: 'Vision models typically rely on fine-tuning general-purpose models pre-trained
  on large, static datasets. These general-purpose models only capture the knowledge
  within their pre-training datasets, which are tiny, out-of-date snapshots of the
  Internetâ€”where billions of images are uploaded each day. We suggest an alternate
  approach: rather than hoping our static datasets transfer to our desired tasks after
  large-scale pre-training, we propose dynamically utilizing the Internet to quickly
  train a small-scale model that does extremely well on a target dataset. Our approach,
  called Internet Explorer, explores the web in a self-supervised manner to progressively
  find relevant examples that improve performance on a desired target dataset. It
  cycles between searching for images on the Internet with text queries, self-supervised
  training on downloaded images, determining which images were useful, and prioritizing
  what to search for next. We evaluate Internet Explorer across several datasets and
  show that it outperforms or matches CLIP oracle performance using just a single
  GPU desktop to actively query the Internet for 30-40 hours.'
