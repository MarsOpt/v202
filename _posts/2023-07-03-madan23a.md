title: Learning GFlowNets From Partial Episodes For Improved Convergence And Stability
openreview: SdOn9JSyTx
abstract: Generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are a family of algorithms for training
  a sequential sampler of discrete objects under an unnormalized target density and
  have been successfully used for various probabilistic modeling tasks. Existing training
  objectives for GFlowNets are either local to states or transitions, or propagate
  a reward signal over an entire sampling trajectory. We argue that these alternatives
  represent opposite ends of a gradient bias-variance tradeoff and propose a way to
  exploit this tradeoff to mitigate its harmful effects. Inspired by the TD($\lambda$)
  algorithm in reinforcement learning, we introduce <em>subtrajectory balance</em>
  or SubTB($\lambda$), a GFlowNet training objective that can learn from partial action
  subsequences of varying lengths. We show that SubTB($\lambda$) accelerates sampler
  convergence in previously studied and new environments and enables training GFlowNets
  in environments with longer action sequences and sparser reward landscapes than
  what was possible before. We also perform a comparative analysis of stochastic gradient
  dynamics, shedding light on the bias-variance tradeoff in GFlowNet training and
  the advantages of subtrajectory balance.
