title: Optimizing NOTEARS Objectives via Topological Swaps
openreview: BTwEqF0s34
abstract: Recently, an intriguing class of non-convex optimization problems has emerged
  in the context of learning directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). These problems involve
  minimizing a given loss or score function, subject to a non-convex continuous constraint
  that penalizes the presence of cycles in a graph. In this work, we delve into the
  optimality challenges associated with this class of non-convex programs. To address
  these challenges, we propose a bi-level algorithm that leverages the non-convex
  constraint in a novel way. The outer level of the algorithm optimizes over topological
  orders by iteratively swapping pairs of nodes within the topological order of a
  DAG. A key innovation of our approach is the development of an effective method
  for generating a set of candidate swapping pairs for each iteration. At the inner
  level, given a topological order, we utilize off-the-shelf solvers that can handle
  linear constraints. The key advantage of our proposed algorithm is that it is guaranteed
  to find a local minimum or a KKT point under weaker conditions compared to previous
  work and finds solutions with lower scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
  our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of achieving a better
  score. Additionally, our method can also be used as a post-processing algorithm
  to significantly improve the score of other algorithms. Code implementing the proposed
  method is available at https://github.com/duntrain/topo.
