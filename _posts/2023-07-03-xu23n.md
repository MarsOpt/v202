title: Geometric Latent Diffusion Models for 3D Molecule Generation
openreview: sLfHWWrfe2
abstract: Generative models, especially diffusion models (DMs), have achieved promising
  results for generating feature-rich geometries and advancing foundational science
  problems such as molecule design. Inspired by the recent huge success of Stable
  (latent) Diffusion models, we propose a novel and principled method for 3D molecule
  generation named Geometric Latent Diffusion Models (GeoLDM). GeoLDM is the first
  latent DM model for the molecular geometry domain, composed of autoencoders encoding
  structures into continuous latent codes and DMs operating in the latent space. Our
  key innovation is that for modeling the 3D molecular geometries, we capture its
  critical roto-translational equivariance constraints by building a point-structured
  latent space with both invariant scalars and equivariant tensors. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate that GeoLDM can consistently achieve better performance on multiple
  molecule generation benchmarks, with up to 7% improvement for the valid percentage
  of large biomolecules. Results also demonstrate GeoLDMâ€™s higher capacity for controllable
  generation thanks to the latent modeling. Code is provided at https://github.com/MinkaiXu/GeoLDM.
