title: A Critical Revisit of Adversarial Robustness in 3D Point Cloud Recognition
  with Diffusion-Driven Purification
openreview: dwn6o2pYJp
abstract: '3D point clouds serve as a crucial data representation in numerous real-world
  applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging. While the
  advancements in deep learning have spurred the utilization of 3D point clouds, deep
  models are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Various defense solutions
  have been proposed to build robust models against adversarial attacks. In this work,
  we pinpoint a major limitation of the leading empirical defense, adversarial training,
  when applied to 3D point cloud models: gradient obfuscation, which significantly
  hampers robustness against potent attacks. To bridge the gap, we propose PointDP,
  a purification strategy that leverages diffusion models to defend against 3D adversarial
  attacks. Since PointDP does not rely on predefined adversarial examples for training,
  it can defend against a variety of threats. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
  of PointDP across six representative 3D point cloud architectures, employing sixteen
  strong and adaptive attacks to manifest its foundational robustness. Our evaluation
  shows that PointDP achieves significantly better (i.e., 12.6%-40.3%) adversarial
  robustness than state-of-the-art methods under strong attacks bounded by different
  $\ell_p$ norms.'
