title: Provably Learning Diverse Features in Multi-View Data with Midpoint Mixup
openreview: TXGh5DI3FP
abstract: Mixup is a data augmentation technique that relies on training using random
  convex combinations of data points and their labels. In recent years, Mixup has
  become a standard primitive used in the training of state-of-the-art image classification
  models due to its demonstrated benefits over empirical risk minimization with regards
  to generalization and robustness. In this work, we try to explain some of this success
  from a feature learning perspective. We focus our attention on classification problems
  in which each class may have multiple associated features (or $\textit{views}$)
  that can be used to predict the class correctly. Our main theoretical results demonstrate
  that, for a non-trivial class of data distributions with two features per class,
  training a 2-layer convolutional network using empirical risk minimization can lead
  to learning only one feature for almost all classes while training with a specific
  instantiation of Mixup succeeds in learning both features for every class. We also
  show empirically that these theoretical insights extend to the practical settings
  of image benchmarks modified to have multiple features.
