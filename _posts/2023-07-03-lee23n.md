title: 'QASA: Advanced Question Answering on Scientific Articles'
openreview: 5ud0h8OXwD
abstract: 'Reasoning is the crux of intellectual thinking. While question answering
  (QA) tasks are prolific with various computational models and benchmark datasets,
  they mostly tackle factoid or shallow QA without asking deeper understanding. Dual
  process theory asserts that human reasoning consists of associative thinking to
  collect relevant pieces of knowledge and logical reasoning to consciously conclude
  grounding on evidential rationale. Based on our intensive think-aloud study that
  revealed the three types of questions: surface, testing, and deep questions, we
  first propose the QASA benchmark that consists of 1798 novel question answering
  pairs that require full-stack reasoning on scientific articles in AI and ML fields.
  Then we propose the QASA approach that tackles the full-stack reasoning with large
  language models via associative selection, evidential rationale-generation, and
  systematic composition. Our experimental results show that QASAâ€™s full-stack inference
  outperforms the state-of-the-art InstructGPT by a big margin. We also find that
  rationale-generation is critical for the performance gain, claiming how we should
  rethink advanced question answering. The dataset is available at https://github.com/lgresearch/QASA.'
