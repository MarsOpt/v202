title: 'QAS-Bench: Rethinking Quantum Architecture Search and A Benchmark'
openreview: Fu8URyrpiY
abstract: 'Automatic quantum architecture search (QAS) has been widely studied across
  disciplines with different implications. In this paper, beyond a particular domain,
  we formulate the QAS problem into two basic (and relatively even ideal) tasks: i)
  arbitrary quantum circuit (QC) regeneration given a target QC; ii) approximating
  an arbitrary unitary (oracle). The latter can be connected to the setting of various
  quantum machine learning tasks and other QAS applications. Based on these two tasks,
  we generate a public QAS benchmark including 900 random QCs and 400 random unitary
  matrices which is still missing in the literature. We evaluate six baseline algorithms
  including brute force search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, reinforcement
  learning, hybrid algorithm, and differentiable algorithm as part of our benchmark.
  One characteristic of our proposed evaluation protocol on the basic tasks is that
  it deprives the domain-specific designs and techniques as used in existing QAS literature,
  making a unified evaluation possible and focusing on the vanilla search methods
  themselves without coupling with domain prior. In fact, the unitary approximation
  task could be algorithmically more difficult than the specific problems as it needs
  to explore the whole matrix space to fit the unitary. While specific tasks often
  only need to fit a partial observation of the unitary as the objective for search.
