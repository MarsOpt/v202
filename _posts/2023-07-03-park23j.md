title: Neural Stochastic Differential Games for Time-series Analysis
openreview: Z1kD2xOpVl
abstract: Modeling spatiotemporal dynamics with neural differential equations has
  become a major line of research that opens new ways to handle various real-world
  scenarios (e.g., missing observations, irregular times, etc.). Despite such progress,
  most existing methods still face challenges in providing a general framework for
  analyzing time series. To tackle this, we adopt stochastic differential games to
  suggest a new philosophy of utilizing interacting collective intelligence in time
  series analysis. For the implementation, we develop the novel gradient descent-based
  algorithm called deep neural fictitious play to approximate the Nash equilibrium.
  We theoretically analyze the convergence result of the proposed algorithm and discuss
  the advantage of cooperative games in handling noninformative observation. Throughout
  the experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework
  over all the tested benchmarks in modeling time-series prediction by capitalizing
  on the advantages of applying cooperative games. An ablation study shows that neural
  agents of the proposed framework learn intrinsic temporal relevance to make accurate
  time-series predictions.
