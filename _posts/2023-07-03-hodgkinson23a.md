title: Monotonicity and Double Descent in Uncertainty Estimation with Gaussian Processes
openreview: 47kHz7I8lJ
abstract: 'Despite their importance for assessing reliability of predictions, uncertainty
  quantification (UQ) measures in machine learning models have only recently begun
  to be rigorously characterized. One prominent issue is the <em>curse of dimensionality</em>:
  it is commonly believed that the marginal likelihood should be reminiscent of cross-validation
  metrics and both should deteriorate with larger input dimensions. However, we prove
  that by tuning hyperparameters to maximize marginal likelihood (the empirical Bayes
  procedure), performance, as measured by the marginal likelihood, <em>improves monotonically</em>
  with the input dimension. On the other hand, cross-validation metrics exhibit qualitatively
  different behavior that is characteristic of double descent. Cold posteriors, which
  have recently attracted interest due to their improved performance in certain settings,
  appear to exacerbate these phenomena. We verify empirically that our results hold
  for real data, beyond our considered assumptions, and we explore consequences involving
  synthetic covariates.'
