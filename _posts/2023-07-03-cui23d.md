title: 'IRNeXt: Rethinking Convolutional Network Design for Image Restoration'
openreview: MZkbgahv4a
abstract: We present IRNeXt, a simple yet effective convolutional network architecture
  for image restoration. Recently, Transformer models have dominated the field of
  image restoration due to the powerful ability of modeling long-range pixels interactions.
  In this paper, we excavate the potential of the convolutional neural network (CNN)
  and show that our CNN-based model can receive comparable or better performance than
  Transformer models with low computation overhead on several image restoration tasks.
  By re-examining the characteristics possessed by advanced image restoration algorithms,
  we discover several key factors leading to the performance improvement of restoration
  models. This motivates us to develop a novel network for image restoration based
  on cheap convolution operators. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IRNeXt
  delivers state-of-the-art performance among numerous datasets on a range of image
  restoration tasks with low computational complexity, including image dehazing, single-image
  defocus/motion deblurring, image deraining, and image desnowing. https://github.com/c-yn/IRNeXt.
