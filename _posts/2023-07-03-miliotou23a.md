title: Generative Decoding of Visual Stimuli
openreview: 57OuafQmu8
abstract: Reconstructing natural images from fMRI recordings is a challenging task
  of great importance in neuroscience. The current architectures are bottlenecked
  because they fail to effectively capture the hierarchical processing of visual stimuli
  that takes place in the human brain. Motivated by that fact, we introduce a novel
  neural network architecture for the problem of neural decoding. Our architecture
  uses Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (HVAEs) to learn meaningful representations
  of natural images and leverages their latent space hierarchy to learn voxel-to-image
  mappings. By mapping the early stages of the visual pathway to the first set of
  latent variables and the higher visual cortex areas to the deeper layers in the
  latent hierarchy, we are able to construct a latent variable neural decoding model
  that replicates the hierarchical visual information processing. Our model achieves
  better reconstructions compared to the state of the art and our ablation study indicates
  that the hierarchical structure of the latent space is responsible for that performance.
