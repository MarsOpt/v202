title: 'Live in the Moment: Learning Dynamics Model Adapted to Evolving Policy'
openreview: unWBARk7v2
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) often achieves higher sample efficiency
  in practice than model-free RL by learning a dynamics model to generate samples
  for policy learning. Previous works learn a dynamics model that fits under the empirical
  state-action visitation distribution for all historical policies, i.e., the sample
  replay buffer. However, in this paper, we observe that fitting the dynamics model
  under the distribution for <em>all historical policies</em> does not necessarily
  benefit model prediction for the <em>current policy</em> since the policy in use
  is constantly evolving over time. The evolving policy during training will cause
  state-action visitation distribution shifts. We theoretically analyze how this distribution
  shift over historical policies affects the model learning and model rollouts. We
  then propose a novel dynamics model learning method, named <em>Policy-adapted Dynamics
  Model Learning (PDML)</em>. PDML dynamically adjusts the historical policy mixture
  distribution to ensure the learned model can continually adapt to the state-action
  visitation distribution of the evolving policy. Experiments on a range of continuous
  control environments in MuJoCo show that PDML achieves significant improvement in
  sample efficiency and higher asymptotic performance combined with the state-of-the-art
  model-based RL methods.
