title: Optimal LP Rounding and Linear-Time Approximation Algorithms for Clustering
  Edge-Colored Hypergraphs
openreview: eZK32L3Pl2
abstract: We study the approximability of an existing framework for clustering edge-colored
  hypergraphs, which is closely related to chromatic correlation clustering and is
  motivated by machine learning and data mining applications where the goal is to
  cluster a set of objects based on multiway interactions of different categories
  or types. We present improved approximation guarantees based on linear programming,
  and show they are tight by proving a matching integrality gap. Our results also
  include new approximation hardness results, a combinatorial 2-approximation whose
  runtime is linear in the hypergraph size, and several new connections to well-studied
  objectives such as vertex cover and hypergraph multiway cut.
