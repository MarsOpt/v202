title: Efficient Rate Optimal Regret for Adversarial Contextual MDPs Using Online
  Function Approximation
openreview: 5UZYtGEPTt
abstract: We present the OMG-CMDP! algorithm for regret minimization in adversarial
  Contextual MDPs. The algorithm operates under the minimal assumptions of realizable
  function class and access to online least squares and log loss regression oracles.
  Our algorithm is efficient (assuming efficient online regression oracles), simple
  and robust to approximation errors. It enjoys an $\widetilde{O}(H^{2.5} \sqrt{ T|S||A|
  ( \mathcal{R}_{TH}(\mathcal{O}) + H \log(\delta^{-1}) )})$ regret guarantee, with
  $T$ being the number of episodes, $S$ the state space, $A$ the action space, $H$
  the horizon and $\mathcal{R}_{TH}(\mathcal{O}) = \mathcal{R}_{TH}(\mathcal{O}_{sq}^\mathcal{F})
  + \mathcal{R}_{TH}(\mathcal{O}_{log}^\mathcal{P})$ is the sum of the square and
  log-loss regression oraclesâ€™ regret, used to approximate the context-dependent rewards
  and dynamics, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first
  efficient rate optimal regret minimization algorithm for adversarial CMDPs that
  operates under the minimal standard assumption of online function approximation.
