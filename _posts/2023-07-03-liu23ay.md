title: 'Partially Observable Multi-agent RL with (Quasi-)Efficiency: The Blessing
  of Information Sharing'
openreview: 6dnHrArK48
abstract: We study provable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the general
  framework of partially observable stochastic games (POSGs). To circumvent the known
  hardness results and the use of computationally intractable oracles, we propose
  to leverage the potential <em>information-sharing</em> among agents, a standard
  practice in empirical MARL and a common model for multi-agent control systems with
  communications. We first establish several computation complexity results to justify
  the necessity of information-sharing, as well as the observability assumption that
  has enabled quasi-efficient single-agent RL with partial observations, for computational
  efficiency in solving POSGs. We then propose to further <em>approximate</em> the
  shared common information to construct an approximate model of the POSG, in which
  planning an approximate equilibrium (in terms of solving the original POSG) can
  be quasi-efficient, i.e., of quasi-polynomial-time, under the aforementioned assumptions.
  Furthermore, we develop a partially observable MARL algorithm that is both statistically
  and computationally quasi-efficient. We hope our study can open up the possibilities
  of leveraging and even designing different <em>information structures</em>, for
  developing both sample- and computation-efficient partially observable MARL.
