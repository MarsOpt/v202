title: Efficient List-Decodable Regression using Batches
openreview: rWGp9FbS0Q
abstract: We demonstrate the use of batches in studying list-decodable linear regression,
  in which only $\alpha\in (0,1]$ fraction of batches contain genuine samples from
  a common distribution and the rest can contain arbitrary or even adversarial samples.
  When genuine batches have $\ge \tilde\Omega(1/\alpha)$ samples each, our algorithm
  can efficiently find a small list of potential regression parameters, with a high
  probability that one of them is close to the true parameter. This is the first polynomial
  time algorithm for list-decodable linear regression, and its sample complexity scales
  nearly linearly with the dimension of the covariates. The polynomial time algorithm
  is made possible by the batch structure and may not be feasible without it, as suggested
  by a recent Statistical Query lower bound (Diakonikolas et al., 2021b).
