title: 'When Sparsity Meets Contrastive Models: Less Graph Data Can Bring Better Class-Balanced
  Representations'
openreview: 3jV525Hmqr
abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful models for non-Euclidean data,
  but their training is often accentuated by massive unnecessary computation: on the
  one hand, training on non-Euclidean data has relatively high computational cost
  due to its irregular density properties; on the other hand, the class imbalance
  property often associated with non-Euclidean data cannot be alleviated by the massiveness
  of the data, thus hindering the generalisation of the models. To address the above
  issues, theoretically, we start with a hypothesis about the effectiveness of using
  a subset of training data for GNNs, which is guaranteed by the gradient distance
  between the subset and the full set. Empirically, we also observe that a subset
  of the data can provide informative gradients for model optimization and which changes
  over time dynamically. We name this phenomenon dynamic data sparsity. Additionally,
  we find that pruned sparse contrastive models may miss valuable information, leading
  to a large loss value on the informative subset. Motivated by the above findings,
  we develop a unified data model dynamic sparsity framework called Data Decantation
  (DataDec) to address the above challenges. The key idea of DataDec is to identify
  the informative subset dynamically during the training process by applying sparse
  graph contrastive learning. The effectiveness of DataDec is comprehensively evaluated
  on graph benchmark datasets and we also verify its generalizability on image data.'
