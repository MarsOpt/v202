title: 'Flash: Concept Drift Adaptation in Federated Learning'
openreview: q5RHsg6VRw
abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), adaptive optimization is an effective approach
  to addressing the statistical heterogeneity issue but cannot adapt quickly to concept
  drifts. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive optimizer called Flash that simultaneously
  addresses both statistical heterogeneity and the concept drift issues. The fundamental
  insight is that a concept drift can be detected based on the magnitude of parameter
  updates that are required to fit the global model to each participating clientâ€™s
  local data distribution. Flash uses a two-pronged approach that synergizes client-side
  early-stopping training to facilitate detection of concept drifts and the server-side
  drift-aware adaptive optimization to effectively adjust effective learning rate.
  We theoretically prove that Flash matches the convergence rate of state-of-the-art
  adaptive optimizers and further empirically evaluate the efficacy of Flash on a
  variety of FL benchmarks using different concept drift settings.
