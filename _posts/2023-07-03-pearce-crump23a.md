title: Brauer’s Group Equivariant Neural Networks
openreview: uY7F5bouCN
abstract: 'We provide a full characterisation of all of the possible group equivariant
  neural networks whose layers are some tensor power of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for three
  symmetry groups that are missing from the machine learning literature: $O(n)$, the
  orthogonal group; $SO(n)$, the special orthogonal group; and $Sp(n)$, the symplectic
  group. In particular, we find a spanning set of matrices for the learnable, linear,
  equivariant layer functions between such tensor power spaces in the standard basis
  of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ when the group is $O(n)$ or $SO(n)$, and in the symplectic basis
  of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ when the group is $Sp(n)$.'
