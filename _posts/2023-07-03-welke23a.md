title: Expectation-Complete Graph Representations with Homomorphisms
openreview: ppgRPC14uI
abstract: We investigate novel random graph embeddings that can be computed in expected
  polynomial time and that are able to distinguish all non-isomorphic graphs in expectation.
  Previous graph embeddings have limited expressiveness and either cannot distinguish
  all graphs or cannot be computed efficiently for every graph. To be able to approximate
  arbitrary functions on graphs, we are interested in efficient alternatives that
  become arbitrarily expressive with increasing resources. Our approach is based on
  Lovász’ characterisation of graph isomorphism through an infinite dimensional vector
  of homomorphism counts. Our empirical evaluation shows competitive results on several
  benchmark graph learning tasks.
