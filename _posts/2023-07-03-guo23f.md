title: Linkless Link Prediction via Relational Distillation
openreview: TAwB7FsoJt
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown exceptional performance in the task
  of link prediction. Despite their effectiveness, the high latency brought by non-trivial
  neighborhood data dependency limits GNNs in practical deployments. Conversely, the
  known efficient MLPs are much less effective than GNNs due to the lack of relational
  knowledge. In this work, to combine the advantages of GNNs and MLPs, we start with
  exploring direct knowledge distillation (KD) methods for link prediction, i.e.,
  predicted logit-based matching and node representation-based matching. Upon observing
  direct KD analogs do not perform well for link prediction, we propose a relational
  KD framework, Linkless Link Prediction (LLP), to distill knowledge for link prediction
  with MLPs. Unlike simple KD methods that match independent link logits or node representations,
  LLP distills relational knowledge that is centered around each (anchor) node to
  the student MLP. Specifically, we propose rank-based matching and distribution-based
  matching strategies that complement each other. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  that LLP boosts the link prediction performance of MLPs with significant margins
  and even outperforms the teacher GNNs on 7 out of 8 benchmarks. LLP also achieves
  a 70.68x speedup in link prediction inference compared to GNNs on the large-scale
  OGB dataset.
