title: 'PPG Reloaded: An Empirical Study on What Matters in Phasic Policy Gradient'
openreview: UlOHeXD4MD
abstract: 'In model-free reinforcement learning, recent methods based on a phasic
  policy gradient (PPG) framework have shown impressive improvements in sample efficiency
  and zero-shot generalization on the challenging Procgen benchmark. In PPG, two design
  choices are believed to be the key contributing factors to its superior performance
  over PPO: the high level of value sample reuse and the low frequency of feature
  distillation. However, through an extensive empirical study, we unveil that policy
  regularization and data diversity are what actually matters. In particular, we can
  achieve the same level of performance with low value sample reuse and frequent feature
  distillation, as long as the policy regularization strength and data diversity are
  preserved. In addition, we can maintain the high performance of PPG while reducing
  the computational cost to a similar level as PPO. Our comprehensive study covers
  all 16 Procgen games in both sample efficiency and generalization setups. We hope
  it can advance the understanding of PPG and provide insights for future works.'
