title: 'Function-Space Regularization in Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Perspective'
openreview: 4zGDjvg0vA
abstract: Parameter-space regularization in neural network optimization is a fundamental
  tool for improving generalization. However, standard parameter-space regularization
  methods make it challenging to encode explicit preferences about desired predictive
  functions into neural network training. In this work, we approach regularization
  in neural networks from a probabilistic perspective and show that by viewing parameter-space
  regularization as specifying an empirical prior distribution over the model parameters,
  we can derive a probabilistically well-motivated regularization technique that allows
  explicitly encoding information about desired predictive functions into neural network
  training. This method—which we refer to as function-space empirical Bayes (FS-EB)—includes
  both parameter- and function-space regularization, is mathematically simple, easy
  to implement, and incurs only minimal computational overhead compared to standard
  regularization techniques. We evaluate the utility of this regularization technique
  empirically and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to near-perfect semantic
  shift detection, highly-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates, successful
  task adaption from pre-trained models, and improved generalization under covariate
  shift.
