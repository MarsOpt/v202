title: Measuring the Impact of Programming Language Distribution
openreview: VnGIZsmxDG
abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating neural code models focus on only a small
  subset of programming languages, excluding many popular languages such as Go or
  Rust. To ameliorate this issue, we present the BabelCode framework for execution-based
  evaluation of any benchmark in any language. BabelCode enables new investigations
  into the qualitative performance of models’ memory, runtime, and individual test
  case results. Additionally, we present a new code translation dataset called Translating
  Python Programming Puzzles (TP3) from the Python Programming Puzzles (Schuster et
  al., 2021) benchmark that involves translating expert-level python functions to
  any language. With both BabelCode and the TP3 benchmark, we investigate if balancing
  the distributions of 14 languages in a training dataset improves a large language
  model’s performance on low-resource languages. Training a model on a balanced corpus
  results in, on average, 12.34% higher $pass@k$ across all tasks and languages compared
  to the baseline. We find that this strategy achieves 66.48% better $pass@k$ on low-resource
  languages at the cost of only a 12.94% decrease to high-resource languages. In our
  three translation tasks, this strategy yields, on average, 30.77% better low-resource
  $pass@k$ while having 19.58% worse high-resource $pass@k$.
