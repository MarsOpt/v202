title: 'Sparse Learning of Dynamical Systems in RKHS: An Operator-Theoretic Approach'
openreview: i7ZqmxsJTW
abstract: Transfer operators provide a rich framework for representing the dynamics
  of very general, nonlinear dynamical systems. When interacting with reproducing
  kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), descriptions of dynamics often incur prohibitive data
  storage requirements, motivating dataset sparsification as a precursory step to
  computation. Further, in practice, data is available in the form of trajectories,
  introducing correlation between samples. In this work, we present a method for sparse
  learning of transfer operators from $\beta$-mixing stochastic processes, in both
  discrete and continuous time, and provide sample complexity analysis extending existing
  theoretical guarantees for learning from non-sparse, i.i.d. data. In addressing
  continuous-time settings, we develop precise descriptions using covariance-type
  operators for the infinitesimal generator that aids in the sample complexity analysis.
  We empirically illustrate the efficacy of our sparse embedding approach through
  deterministic and stochastic nonlinear system examples.
