title: Learning Noisy OR Bayesian Networks with Max-Product Belief Propagation
openreview: VTkBZayJos
abstract: Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks (BNs) are a family of probabilistic graphical
  models which express rich statistical dependencies in binary data. Variational inference
  (VI) has been the main method proposed to learn noisy-OR BNs with complex latent
  structures (Jaakkola & Jordan, 1999; Ji et al., 2020; Buhai et al., 2020). However,
  the proposed VI approaches either (a) use a recognition network with standard amortized
  inference that cannot induce "explaining-away"; or (b) assume a simple mean-field
  (MF) posterior which is vulnerable to bad local optima. Existing MF VI methods also
  update the MF parameters sequentially which makes them inherently slow. In this
  paper, we propose parallel max-product as an alternative algorithm for learning
  noisy-OR BNs with complex latent structures and we derive a fast stochastic training
  scheme that scales to large datasets. We evaluate both approaches on several benchmarks
  where VI is the state-of-the-art and show that our method (a) achieves better test
  performance than Ji et al. (2020) for learning noisy-OR BNs with hierarchical latent
  structures on large sparse real datasets; (b) recovers a higher number of ground
  truth parameters than Buhai et al. (2020) from cluttered synthetic scenes; and (c)
  solves the 2D blind deconvolution problem from Lazaro-Gredilla et al. (2021) and
  variants - including binary matrix factorization - while VI catastrophically fails
  and is up to two orders of magnitude slower.
