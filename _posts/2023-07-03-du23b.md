title: Multi-task Representation Learning for Pure Exploration in Linear Bandits
openreview: EqAsFB28T0
abstract: Despite the recent success of representation learning in sequential decision
  making, the study of the pure exploration scenario (i.e., identify the best option
  and minimize the sample complexity) is still limited. In this paper, we study multi-task
  representation learning for best arm identification in linear bandit (RepBAI-LB)
  and best policy identification in contextual linear bandit (RepBPI-CLB), two popular
  pure exploration settings with wide applications, e.g., clinical trials and web
  content optimization. In these two problems, all tasks share a common low-dimensional
  linear representation, and our goal is to leverage this feature to accelerate the
  best arm (policy) identification process for all tasks. For these problems, we design
  computationally and sample efficient algorithms DouExpDes and C-DouExpDes, which
  perform double experimental designs to plan optimal sample allocations for learning
  the global representation. We show that by learning the common representation among
  tasks, our sample complexity is significantly better than that of the native approach
  which solves tasks independently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  work to demonstrate the benefits of representation learning for multi-task pure
  exploration.
