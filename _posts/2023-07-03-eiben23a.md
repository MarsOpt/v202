title: The Computational Complexity of Concise Hypersphere Classification
openreview: 1Ntj4pRk7E
abstract: Hypersphere classification is a classical and foundational method that can
  provide easy-to-process explanations for the classification of real-valued as well
  as binary data. However, obtaining an (ideally concise) explanation via hypersphere
  classification is much more difficult when dealing with binary data as opposed to
  real-valued data. In this paper, we perform the first complexity-theoretic study
  of the hypersphere classification problem for binary data. We use the fine-grained
  parameterized complexity paradigm to analyze the impact of structural properties
  that may be present in the input data as well as potential conciseness constraints.
  Our results include not only stronger lower bounds but also a number of new fixed-parameter
  algorithms for hypersphere classification of binary data, which can find an exact
  and concise explanation when one exists.
