title: 'Fascinating Supervisory Signals and Where to Find Them: Deep Anomaly Detection
  with Scale Learning'
openreview: V6PNBRWRil
abstract: Due to the unsupervised nature of anomaly detection, the key to fueling
  deep models is finding supervisory signals. Different from current reconstruction-guided
  generative models and transformation-based contrastive models, we devise novel data-driven
  supervision for tabular data by introducing a characteristic – scale – as data labels.
  By representing varied sub-vectors of data instances, we define scale as the relationship
  between the dimensionality of original sub-vectors and that of representations.
  Scales serve as labels attached to transformed representations, thus offering ample
  labeled data for neural network training. This paper further proposes a scale learning-based
  anomaly detection method. Supervised by the learning objective of scale distribution
  alignment, our approach learns the ranking of representations converted from varied
  subspaces of each data instance. Through this proxy task, our approach models inherent
  regularities and patterns within data, which well describes data "normality". Abnormal
  degrees of testing instances are obtained by measuring whether they fit these learned
  patterns. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to significant improvement
  over state-of-the-art generative/contrastive anomaly detection methods.
