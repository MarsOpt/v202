title: Theory on Forgetting and Generalization of Continual Learning
openreview: t9oOGDbIpV
abstract: Continual learning (CL), which aims to learn a sequence of tasks, has attracted
  significant recent attention. However, most work has focused on the experimental
  performance of CL, and theoretical studies of CL are still limited. In particular,
  there is a lack of understanding on what factors are important and how they affect
  "catastrophic forgetting" and generalization performance. To fill this gap, our
  theoretical analysis, under overparameterized linear models, provides the first-known
  explicit form of the expected forgetting and generalization error for a general
  CL setup with an arbitrary number of tasks. Further analysis of such a key result
  yields a number of theoretical explanations about how overparameterization, task
  similarity, and task ordering affect both forgetting and generalization error of
  CL. More interestingly, by conducting experiments on real datasets using deep neural
  networks (DNNs), we show that some of these insights even go beyond the linear models
  and can be carried over to practical setups. In particular, we use concrete examples
  to show that our results not only explain some interesting empirical observations
  in recent studies, but also motivate better practical algorithm designs of CL.
