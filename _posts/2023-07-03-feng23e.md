title: Non-stationary Reinforcement Learning under General Function Approximation
openreview: KmJo2sqppO
abstract: General function approximation is a powerful tool to handle large state
  and action spaces in a broad range of reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios. However,
  theoretical understanding of non-stationary MDPs with general function approximation
  is still limited. In this paper, we make the first such an attempt. We first propose
  a new complexity metric called dynamic Bellman Eluder (DBE) dimension for non-stationary
  MDPs, which subsumes majority of existing tractable RL problems in static MDPs as
  well as non-stationary MDPs. Based on the proposed complexity metric, we propose
  a novel confidence-set based model-free algorithm called SW-OPEA, which features
  a sliding window mechanism and a new confidence set design for non-stationary MDPs.
  We then establish an upper bound on the dynamic regret for the proposed algorithm,
  and show that SW-OPEA is provably efficient as long as the variation budget is not
  significantly large. We further demonstrate via examples of non-stationary linear
  and tabular MDPs that our algorithm performs better in small variation budget scenario
  than the existing UCB-type algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
  first dynamic regret analysis in non-stationary MDPs with general function approximation.
