title: 'MyoDex: A Generalizable Prior for Dexterous Manipulation'
openreview: iYBTiYzN0A
abstract: Human dexterity is a hallmark of motor control behaviors. Our hands can
  rapidly synthesize new behaviors despite the complexity (multi-articular and multi-joints,
  with 23 joints controlled by more than 40 muscles) of mosculoskeletal control. In
  this work, we take inspiration from how human dexterity builds on a diversity of
  prior experiences, instead of being acquired through a single task. Motivated by
  this observation, we set out to develop agents that can build upon previous experience
  to quickly acquire new (previously unattainable) behaviors. Specifically, our approach
  leverages multi-task learning to implicitly capture a task-agnostic behavioral priors
  (MyoDex) for human-like dexterity, using a physiologically realistic human hand
  model – MyoHand. We demonstrate MyoDex’s effectiveness in few-shot generalization
  as well as positive transfer to a large repertoire of unseen dexterous manipulation
  tasks. MyoDex can solve approximately 3x more tasks and it can accelerate the achievement
  of solutions by about 4x in comparison to a distillation baseline. While prior work
  has synthesized single musculoskeletal control behaviors, MyoDex is the first generalizable
  manipulation prior that catalyzes the learning of dexterous physiological control
  across a large variety of contact-rich behaviors.
