title: Structured Cooperative Learning with Graphical Model Priors
openreview: hkqT0xJiLL
abstract: We study how to train personalized models for different tasks on decentralized
  devices with limited local data. We propose "Structured Cooperative Learning (SCooL)",
  in which a cooperation graph across devices is generated by a graphical model prior
  to automatically coordinate mutual learning between devices. By choosing graphical
  models enforcing different structures, we can derive a rich class of existing and
  novel decentralized learning algorithms via variational inference. In particular,
  we show three instantiations of SCooL that adopt Dirac distribution, stochastic
  block model (SBM), and attention as the prior generating cooperation graphs. These
  EM-type algorithms alternate between updating the cooperation graph and cooperative
  learning of local models. They can automatically capture the cross-task correlations
  among devices by only monitoring their model updating in order to optimize the cooperation
  graph. We evaluate SCooL and compare it with existing decentralized learning methods
  on an extensive set of benchmarks, on which SCooL always achieves the highest accuracy
  of personalized models and significantly outperforms other baselines on communication
  efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShuangtongLi/SCooL.
