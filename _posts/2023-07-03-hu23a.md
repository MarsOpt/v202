title: Tighter Analysis for ProxSkip
openreview: pqmEDAv8fL
abstract: In this paper, we provide a tighter analysis for ProxSkip, an algorithm
  that allows fewer proximal operator computations to solve composite optimization
  problems. We improve the existing decreasing speed of Lyapunov function from $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$
  to $\mathcal{O}(p)$, when $p$, the frequency of the proximal operators is small
  enough. Our theoretical analysis also reveals the drawbacks of using large step
  sizes for gradient descent in ProxSkip when the proximal operator part is the bottleneck.
  Our main motivation comes from the continuous limit in which the original analysis
  of ProxSkip fails to guarantee convergence when both the step size $\gamma$ and
  frequency $p$ tend to zero. We construct a counterexample to demonstrate why such
  counterintuitive behavior occurs for the original analysis and then propose a novel
  Lyapunov function variant to construct a tighter analysis, avoiding the problem
  of the old one. Such a new Lyapunov function can be directly extended to many other
  variants of ProxSkip. When applied to stochastic gradient setup, our analysis leads
  to an improved proximal operator complexity for SProxSkip from $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{\varepsilon\mu^2}}\log(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}))$
  to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\kappa}\log(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}))$.
