title: Cell-Free Latent Go-Explore
openreview: 4TtG42xJvC
abstract: In this paper, we introduce Latent Go-Explore (LGE), a simple and general
  approach based on the Go-Explore paradigm for exploration in reinforcement learning
  (RL). Go-Explore was initially introduced with a strong domain knowledge constraint
  for partitioning the state space into cells. However, in most real-world scenarios,
  drawing domain knowledge from raw observations is complex and tedious. If the cell
  partitioning is not informative enough, Go-Explore can completely fail to explore
  the environment. We argue that the Go-Explore approach can be generalized to any
  environment without domain knowledge and without cells by exploiting a learned latent
  representation. Thus, we show that LGE can be flexibly combined with any strategy
  for learning a latent representation. Our results indicate that LGE, although simpler
  than Go-Explore, is more robust and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms
  of pure exploration on multiple hard-exploration environments including Montezuma’s
  Revenge. The LGE implementation is available as open-source at https://github.com/qgallouedec/lge.
