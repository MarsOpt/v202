title: 'SpENCNN: Orchestrating Encoding and Sparsity for Fast Homomorphically Encrypted
  Neural Network Inference'
openreview: vPCKyca1s7
abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a promising technology to protect clients’
  data privacy for Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) on public clouds. However,
  HE operations can be orders of magnitude slower than their counterparts for plaintexts
  and thus result in prohibitively high inference latency, seriously hindering the
  practicality of HE. In this paper, we propose a HE-based fast neural network (NN)
  inference framework–SpENCNN built upon the co-design of HE operation-aware model
  sparsity and the single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD)-friendly data packing,
  to improve NN inference latency. In particular, we first develop an encryption-aware
  HE-group convolution technique that can partition channels among different groups
  based on the data size and ciphertext size, and then encode them into the same ciphertext
  by novel group-interleaved encoding, so as to dramatically reduce the number of
  bottlenecked operations in HE convolution. We further tailor a HE-friendly sub-block
  weight pruning to reduce the costly HE-based convolution operation. Our experiments
  show that SpENCNN can achieve overall speedups of 8.37$\times$, 12.11$\times$, 19.26$\times$,
  and 1.87$\times$ for LeNet, VGG-5, HEFNet, and ResNet-20 respectively, with negligible
  accuracy loss. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ranran0523/SPECNN.
