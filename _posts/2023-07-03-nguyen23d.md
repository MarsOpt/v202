title: 'Deep Clustering with Incomplete Noisy Pairwise Annotations: A Geometric Regularization
  Approach'
openreview: ElgoXPdI5l
abstract: 'The recent integration of deep learning and pairwise similarity annotation-based
  constrained clustering—i.e., deep constrained clustering (DCC)—has proven effective
  for incorporating weak supervision into massive data clustering: Less than 1% of
  pair similarity annotations can often substantially enhance the clustering accuracy.
  However, beyond empirical successes, there is a lack of understanding of DCC. In
  addition, many DCC paradigms are sensitive to annotation noise, but performance-guaranteed
  noisy DCC methods have been largely elusive. This work first takes a deep look into
  a recently emerged logistic loss function of DCC, and characterizes its theoretical
  properties. Our result shows that the logistic DCC loss ensures the identifiability
  of data membership under reasonable conditions, which may shed light on its effectiveness
  in practice. Building upon this understanding, a new loss function based on geometric
  factor analysis is proposed to fend against noisy annotations. It is shown that
  even under unknown annotation confusions, the data membership can still be provably
  identified under our proposed learning criterion. The proposed approach is tested
  over multiple datasets to validate our claims.'
