title: Variational Mixture of HyperGenerators for Learning Distributions over Functions
openreview: CV9ovb5fxg
abstract: Recent approaches build on implicit neural representations (INRs) to propose
  generative models over function spaces. However, they are computationally costly
  when dealing with inference tasks, such as missing data imputation, or directly
  cannot tackle them. In this work, we propose a novel deep generative model, named
  VaMoH. VaMoH combines the capabilities of modeling continuous functions using INRs
  and the inference capabilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In addition,
  VaMoH relies on a normalizing flow to define the prior, and a mixture of hypernetworks
  to parametrize the data log-likelihood. This gives VaMoH a high expressive capability
  and interpretability. Through experiments on a diverse range of data types, such
  as images, voxels, and climate data, we show that VaMoH can effectively learn rich
  distributions over continuous functions. Furthermore, it can perform inference-related
  tasks, such as conditional super-resolution generation and in-painting, as well
  or better than previous approaches, while being less computationally demanding.
