title: 'FP-Diffusion: Improving Score-based Diffusion Models by Enforcing the Underlying
  Score Fokker-Planck Equation'
openreview: UULcrko6Hk
abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) learn a family of noise-conditional
  score functions corresponding to the data density perturbed with increasingly large
  amounts of noise. These perturbed data densities are linked together by the Fokker-Planck
  equation (FPE), a partial differential equation (PDE) governing the spatial-temporal
  evolution of a density undergoing a diffusion process. In this work, we derive a
  corresponding equation called the score FPE that characterizes the noise-conditional
  scores of the perturbed data densities (i.e., their gradients). Surprisingly, despite
  the impressive empirical performance, we observe that scores learned through denoising
  score matching (DSM) fail to fulfill the underlying score FPE, which is an inherent
  self-consistency property of the ground truth score. We prove that satisfying the
  score FPE is desirable as it improves the likelihood and the degree of conservativity.
  Hence, we propose to regularize the DSM objective to enforce satisfaction of the
  score FPE, and we show the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets.
