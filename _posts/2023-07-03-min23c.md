title: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Nonstationary Bandit Learning
openreview: OPwwby2wOt
abstract: In nonstationary bandit learning problems, the decision-maker must continually
  gather information and adapt their action selection as the latent state of the environment
  evolves. In each time period, some latent optimal action maximizes expected reward
  under the environment state. We view the optimal action sequence as a stochastic
  process, and take an information-theoretic approach to analyze attainable performance.
  We bound per-period regret in terms of the entropy rate of the optimal action process.
  The bound applies to a wide array of problems studied in the literature and reflects
  the problemâ€™s information structure through its information-ratio.
