title: Towards a better understanding of representation dynamics under TD-learning
openreview: UOgyaswHo7
abstract: 'TD-learning is a foundation reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for value
  prediction. Critical to the accuracy of value predictions is the quality of state
  representations. In this work, we consider the question: how does end-to-end TD-learning
  impact the representation over time? Complementary to prior work, we provide a set
  of analysis that sheds further light on the representation dynamics under TD-learning.
  We first show that when the environments are reversible, end-to-end TD-learning
  strictly decreases the value approximation error over time. Under further assumptions
  on the environments, we can connect the representation dynamics with spectral decomposition
  over the transition matrix. This latter finding establishes fitting multiple value
  functions from randomly generated rewards as a useful auxiliary task for representation
  learning, as we empirically validate on both tabular and Atari game suites.'
