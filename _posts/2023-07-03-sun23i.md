title: When and How Does Known Class Help Discover Unknown Ones? Provable Understanding
  Through Spectral Analysis
openreview: JHodnaW5WZ
abstract: Novel Class Discovery (NCD) aims at inferring novel classes in an unlabeled
  set by leveraging prior knowledge from a labeled set with known classes. Despite
  its importance, there is a lack of theoretical foundations for NCD. This paper bridges
  the gap by providing an analytical framework to formalize and investigate when and
  how known classes can help discover novel classes. Tailored to the NCD problem,
  we introduce a graph-theoretic representation that can be learned by a novel NCD
  Spectral Contrastive Loss (NSCL). Minimizing this objective is equivalent to factorizing
  the graphâ€™s adjacency matrix, which allows us to derive a provable error bound and
  provide the sufficient and necessary condition for NCD. Empirically, NSCL can match
  or outperform several strong baselines on common benchmark datasets, which is appealing
  for practical usage while enjoying theoretical guarantees.
