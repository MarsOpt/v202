title: Estimating the Contamination Factor’s Distribution in Unsupervised Anomaly
  Detection
openreview: pf3NihScj1
abstract: Anomaly detection methods identify examples that do not follow the expected
  behaviour, typically in an unsupervised fashion, by assigning real-valued anomaly
  scores to the examples based on various heuristics. These scores need to be transformed
  into actual predictions by thresholding so that the proportion of examples marked
  as anomalies equals the expected proportion of anomalies, called contamination factor.
  Unfortunately, there are no good methods for estimating the contamination factor
  itself. We address this need from a Bayesian perspective, introducing a method for
  estimating the posterior distribution of the contamination factor for a given unlabeled
  dataset. We leverage several anomaly detectors to capture the basic notion of anomalousness
  and estimate the contamination using a specific mixture formulation. Empirically
  on 22 datasets, we show that the estimated distribution is well-calibrated and that
  setting the threshold using the posterior mean improves the detectors’ performance
  over several alternative methods.
