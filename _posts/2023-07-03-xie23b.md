title: Future-conditioned Unsupervised Pretraining for Decision Transformer
openreview: 7maTHA7zua
abstract: Recent research in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated
  that return-conditioned supervised learning is a powerful paradigm for decision-making
  problems. While promising, return conditioning is limited to training data labeled
  with rewards and therefore faces challenges in learning from unsupervised data.
  In this work, we aim to utilize generalized future conditioning to enable efficient
  unsupervised pretraining from reward-free and sub-optimal offline data. We propose
  Pretrained Decision Transformer (PDT), a conceptually simple approach for unsupervised
  RL pretraining. PDT leverages future trajectory information as a privileged context
  to predict actions during training. The ability to make decisions based on both
  present and future factors enhances PDTâ€™s capability for generalization. Besides,
  this feature can be easily incorporated into a return-conditioned framework for
  online finetuning, by assigning return values to possible futures and sampling future
  embeddings based on their respective values. Empirically, PDT outperforms or performs
  on par with its supervised pretraining counterpart, especially when dealing with
  sub-optimal data. Further analysis reveals that PDT can extract diverse behaviors
  from offline data and controllably sample high-return behaviors by online finetuning.
