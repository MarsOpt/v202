title: Sequential Multi-Dimensional Self-Supervised Learning for Clinical Time Series
openreview: WhRLdsDTBD
abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for clinical time series data has received
  significant attention in recent literature, since these data are highly rich and
  provide important information about a patient’s physiological state. However, most
  existing SSL methods for clinical time series are limited in that they are designed
  for unimodal time series, such as a sequence of structured features (e.g., lab values
  and vitals signs) or an individual high-dimensional physiological signal (e.g.,
  an electrocardiogram). These existing methods cannot be readily extended to model
  time series that exhibit multimodality, with structured features and high-dimensional
  data being recorded at each timestep in the sequence. In this work, we address this
  gap and propose a new SSL method — Sequential Multi-Dimensional SSL — where a SSL
  loss is applied both at the level of the entire sequence and at the level of the
  individual high-dimensional data points in the sequence in order to better capture
  information at both scales. Our strategy is agnostic to the specific form of loss
  function used at each level – it can be contrastive, as in SimCLR, or non-contrastive,
  as in VICReg. We evaluate our method on two real-world clinical datasets, where
  the time series contains sequences of (1) high-frequency electrocardiograms and
  (2) structured data from lab values and vitals signs. Our experimental results indicate
  that pre-training with our method and then fine-tuning on downstream tasks improves
  performance over baselines on both datasets, and in several settings, can lead to
  improvements across different self-supervised loss functions.
