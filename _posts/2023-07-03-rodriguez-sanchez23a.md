title: 'RLang: A Declarative Language for Describing Partial World Knowledge to Reinforcement
  Learning Agents'
openreview: dA6biC3XgO
abstract: We introduce RLang, a domain-specific language (DSL) for communicating domain
  knowledge to an RL agent. Unlike existing RL DSLs that ground to $\textit{single}$
  elements of a decision-making formalism (e.g., the reward function or policy), RLang
  can specify information about every element of a Markov decision process. We define
  precise syntax and grounding semantics for RLang, and provide a parser that grounds
  RLang programs to an algorithm-agnostic $\textit{partial}$ world model and policy
  that can be exploited by an RL agent. We provide a series of example RLang programs
  demonstrating how different RL methods can exploit the resulting knowledge, encompassing
  model-free and model-based tabular algorithms, policy gradient and value-based methods,
  hierarchical approaches, and deep methods.
