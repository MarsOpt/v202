title: 'Convergence of Proximal Point and Extragradient-Based Methods Beyond Monotonicity:
  the Case of Negative Comonotonicity'
openreview: dvu47LPkEV
abstract: Algorithms for min-max optimization and variational inequalities are often
  studied under monotonicity assumptions. Motivated by non-monotone machine learning
  applications, we follow the line of works (Diakonikolas et al., 2021; Lee & Kim,
  2021; Pethick et al., 2022; Bohm,2022) aiming at going beyond monotonicity by considering
  the weaker <em>negative comonotonicity</em> assumption. In this work, we provide
  tight complexity analyses for the Proximal Point (PP), Extragradient (EG), and Optimistic
  Gradient (OG) methods in this setup, closing several questions on their working
  guarantees beyond monotonicity. In particular, we derive the first non-asymptotic
  convergence rates for PP under negative comonotonicity and star-negative comonotonicity
  and show their tightness via constructing worst-case examples; we also relax the
  assumptions for the last-iterate convergence guarantees for EG and OG and prove
  the tightness of the existing best-iterate guarantees for EG and OG via constructing
  counter-examples.
