title: New metrics and search algorithms for weighted causal DAGs
openreview: gnb9UUFqsc
abstract: 'Recovering causal relationships from data is an important problem. Using
  observational data, one can typically only recover causal graphs up to a Markov
  equivalence class and additional assumptions or interventional data are needed for
  complete recovery. In this work, under some standard assumptions, we study causal
  graph discovery via <em>adaptive interventions with node-dependent interventional
  costs</em>. For this setting, we show that no algorithm can achieve an approximation
  guarantee that is asymptotically better than linear in the number of vertices with
  respect to the verification number; a well-established benchmark for adaptive search
  algorithms. Motivated by this negative result, we define a <em>new benchmark</em>
  that captures the worst-case interventional cost for any search algorithm. Furthermore,
  with respect to this new benchmark, we provide adaptive search algorithms that achieve
  logarithmic approximations under various settings: atomic, bounded size interventions
  and generalized cost objectives.'
