title: 'Divide and Conquer Dynamic Programming: An Almost Linear Time Change Point
  Detection Methodology in High Dimensions'
openreview: EqHTMU4YbA
abstract: 'We develop a novel, general and computationally efficient framework, called
  Divide and Conquer Dynamic Programming (DCDP), for localizing change points in time
  series data with high-dimensional features. DCDP deploys a class of greedy algorithms
  that are applicable to a broad variety of high-dimensional statistical models and
  can enjoy almost linear computational complexity. We investigate the performance
  of DCDP in three commonly studied change point settings in high dimensions: the
  mean model, the Gaussian graphical model, and the linear regression model. In all
  three cases, we derive non-asymptotic bounds for the accuracy of the DCDP change
  point estimators. We demonstrate that the DCDP procedures consistently estimate
  the change points with sharp, and in some cases, optimal rates while incurring significantly
  smaller computational costs than the best available algorithms. Our findings are
  supported by extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data.'
