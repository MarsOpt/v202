title: Disentangled Multi-Fidelity Deep Bayesian Active Learning
openreview: jOLIFanYnt
abstract: To balance quality and cost, various domain areas of science and engineering
  run simulations at multiple levels of sophistication. Multi-fidelity active learning
  aims to learn a direct mapping from input parameters to simulation outputs at the
  highest fidelity by actively acquiring data from multiple fidelity levels. However,
  existing approaches based on Gaussian processes are hardly scalable to high-dimensional
  data. Deep learning-based methods often impose a hierarchical structure in hidden
  representations, which only supports passing information from low-fidelity to high-fidelity.
  These approaches can lead to the undesirable propagation of errors from low-fidelity
  representations to high-fidelity ones. We propose a novel framework called Disentangled
  Multi-fidelity Deep Bayesian Active Learning (D-MFDAL), which learns the surrogate
  models conditioned on the distribution of functions at multiple fidelities. On benchmark
  tasks of learning deep surrogates of partial differential equations including heat
  equation, Poissonâ€™s equation and fluid simulations, our approach significantly outperforms
  state-of-the-art in prediction accuracy and sample efficiency.
