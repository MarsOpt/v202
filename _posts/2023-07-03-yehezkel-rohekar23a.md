title: From Temporal to Contemporaneous Iterative Causal Discovery in the Presence
  of Latent Confounders
openreview: cnGgsXpf2H
abstract: We present a constraint-based algorithm for learning causal structures from
  observational time-series data, in the presence of latent confounders. We assume
  a discrete-time, stationary structural vector autoregressive process, with both
  temporal and contemporaneous causal relations. One may ask if temporal and contemporaneous
  relations should be treated differently. The presented algorithm gradually refines
  a causal graph by learning long-term temporal relations before short-term ones,
  where contemporaneous relations are learned last. This ordering of causal relations
  to be learnt leads to a reduction in the required number of statistical tests. We
  validate this reduction empirically and demonstrate that it leads to higher accuracy
  for synthetic data and more plausible causal graphs for real-world data compared
  to state-of-the-art algorithms.
