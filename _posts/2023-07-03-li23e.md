title: Learning Preconditioners for Conjugate Gradient PDE Solvers
openreview: 3XeVnDFcFk
abstract: Efficient numerical solvers for partial differential equations empower science
  and engineering. One commonly employed numerical solver is the preconditioned conjugate
  gradient (PCG) algorithm, whose performance is largely affected by the preconditioner
  quality. However, designing high-performing preconditioner with traditional numerical
  methods is highly non-trivial, often requiring problem-specific knowledge and meticulous
  matrix operations. We present a new method that leverages learning-based approach
  to obtain an approximate matrix factorization to the system matrix to be used as
  a preconditioner in the context of PCG solvers. Our high-level intuition comes from
  the shared property between preconditioners and network-based PDE solvers that excels
  at obtaining approximate solutions at a low computational cost. Such observation
  motivates us to represent preconditioners as graph neural networks (GNNs). In addition,
  we propose a new loss function that rewrites traditional preconditioner metrics
  to incorporate inductive bias from PDE data distributions, enabling effective training
  of high-performing preconditioners. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate
  the efficacy and generalizability of our proposed approach on solving various 2D
  and 3D linear second-order PDEs.
