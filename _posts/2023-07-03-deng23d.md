title: 'Surrogate Module Learning: Reduce the Gradient Error Accumulation in Training
  Spiking Neural Networks'
openreview: zRkz4duLKp
abstract: Spiking neural networks provide an alternative solution to conventional
  artificial neural networks with energy-saving and high-efficiency characteristics
  after hardware implantation. However, due to its non-differentiable activation function
  and the temporally delayed accumulation in outputs, the direct training of SNNs
  is extraordinarily tough even adopting a surrogate gradient to mimic the backpropagation.
  For SNN training, this non-differentiability causes the intrinsic gradient error
  that would be magnified through layerwise backpropagation, especially through multiple
  layers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reducing gradient error from
  a new perspective called surrogate module learning (SML). Surrogate module learning
  tries to construct a shortcut path to back-propagate more accurate gradient to a
  certain SNN part utilizing the surrogate modules. Then, we develop a new loss function
  for concurrently training the network and enhancing the surrogate modulesâ€™ surrogate
  capacity. We demonstrate that when the outputs of surrogate modules are close to
  the SNN output, the fraction of the gradient error drops significantly. Our method
  consistently and significantly enhances the performance of SNNs on all experiment
  datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and ES-ImageNet. For example, for spiking
  ResNet-34 architecture on ImageNet, we increased the SNN accuracy by 3.46%.
