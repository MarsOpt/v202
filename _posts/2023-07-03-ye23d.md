title: Corruption-Robust Algorithms with Uncertainty Weighting for Nonlinear Contextual
  Bandits and Markov Decision Processes
openreview: 9xMuDDbWIW
abstract: Despite the significant interest and progress in reinforcement learning
  (RL) problems with adversarial corruption, current works are either confined to
  the linear setting or lead to an undesired $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T}\zeta)$ regret
  bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $\zeta$ is the total amount of corruption.
  In this paper, we consider contextual bandits with general function approximation
  and propose a computationally efficient algorithm to achieve a regret of $\tilde{\mathcal
  O}(\sqrt{T}+\zeta)$. The proposed algorithm relies on the recently developed uncertainty-weighted
  least-squares regression from linear contextual bandits (He et al., 2022) and a
  new weighted estimator of uncertainty for the general function class. In contrast
  to the existing analysis for the sum of uncertainty that is heavily based on the
  linear structure, we develop a novel technique to control the sum of weighted uncertainty,
  thus establishing the final regret bound. We then generalize our algorithm to the
  episodic MDP and first achieve an additive dependence on the corruption level $\zeta$
  in the scenario of general function approximation. Notably, our algorithms achieve
  regret bounds that either nearly match the lower bound or improve the performance
  of existing methods for all the corruption levels in both known and unknown $\zeta$
  cases.
