title: Performative Reinforcement Learning
openreview: 0HDtFc4LGi
abstract: We introduce the framework of performative reinforcement learning where
  the policy chosen by the learner affects the underlying reward and transition dynamics
  of the environment. Following the recent literature on performative prediction (Perdomo
  et al., 2020), we introduce the concept of performatively stable policy. We then
  consider a regularized version of the reinforcement learning problem and show that
  repeatedly optimizing this objective converges to a performatively stable policy
  under reasonable assumptions on the transition dynamics. Our proof utilizes the
  dual perspective of the reinforcement learning problem and may be of independent
  interest in analyzing the convergence of other algorithms with decision-dependent
  environments. We then extend our results for the setting where the learner just
  performs gradient ascent steps instead of fully optimizing the objective, and for
  the setting where the learner has access to a finite number of trajectories from
  the changed environment. For both the settings, we leverage the dual formulation
  of performative reinforcement learning, and establish convergence to a stable solution.
  Finally, through extensive experiments on a grid-world environment, we demonstrate
  the dependence of convergence on various parameters e.g. regularization, smoothness,
  and the number of samples.
