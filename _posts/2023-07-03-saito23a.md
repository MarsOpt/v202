title: Multi-class Graph Clustering via Approximated Effective $p$-Resistance
openreview: d65OJgQp5Q
abstract: This paper develops an approximation to the (effective) $p$-resistance and
  applies it to multi-class clustering. Spectral methods based on the graph Laplacian
  and its generalization to the graph $p$-Laplacian have been a backbone of non-euclidean
  clustering techniques. The advantage of the $p$-Laplacian is that the parameter
  $p$ induces a controllable bias on cluster structure. The drawback of $p$-Laplacian
  eigenvector based methods is that the third and higher eigenvectors are difficult
  to compute. Thus, instead, we are motivated to use the $p$-resistance induced by
  the $p$-Laplacian for clustering. For $p$-resistance, small $p$ biases towards clusters
  with high internal connectivity while large $p$ biases towards clusters of small
  “extent,” that is a preference for smaller shortest-path distances between vertices
  in the cluster. However, the $p$-resistance is expensive to compute. We overcome
  this by developing an approximation to the $p$-resistance. We prove upper and lower
  bounds on this approximation and observe that it is exact when the graph is a tree.
  We also provide theoretical justification for the use of $p$-resistance for clustering.
  Finally, we provide experiments comparing our approximated $p$-resistance clustering
  to other $p$-Laplacian based methods.
