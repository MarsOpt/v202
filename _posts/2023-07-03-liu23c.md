title: Learning Representations without Compositional Assumptions
openreview: dx7BosxkOv
abstract: This paper addresses unsupervised representation learning on tabular data
  containing multiple views generated by distinct sources of measurement. Traditional
  methods, which tackle this problem using the multi-view framework, are constrained
  by predefined assumptions that assume feature sets share the same information and
  representations should learn globally shared factors. However, this assumption is
  not always valid for real-world tabular datasets with complex dependencies between
  feature sets, resulting in localized information that is harder to learn. To overcome
  this limitation, we propose a data-driven approach that learns feature set dependencies
  by representing feature sets as graph nodes and their relationships as learnable
  edges. Furthermore, we introduce $\texttt{LEGATO}$, a novel hierarchical graph autoencoder
  that learns a smaller, latent graph to aggregate information from multiple views
  dynamically. This approach results in latent graph components that specialize in
  capturing localized information from different regions of the input, leading to
  superior downstream performance.
