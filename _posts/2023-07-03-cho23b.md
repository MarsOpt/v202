title: On the Convergence of Federated Averaging with Cyclic Client Participation
openreview: d8LTNXt97w
abstract: Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its variants are the most popular optimization
  algorithms in federated learning (FL). Previous convergence analyses of FedAvg either
  assume full client participation or partial client participation where the clients
  can be uniformly sampled. However, in practical cross-device FL systems, only a
  subset of clients that satisfy local criteria such as battery status, network connectivity,
  and maximum participation frequency requirements (to ensure privacy) are available
  for training at a given time. As a result, client availability follows a <em>natural
  cyclic pattern</em>. We provide (to our knowledge) the first theoretical framework
  to analyze the convergence of FedAvg with cyclic client participation with several
  different client optimizers such as GD, SGD, and shuffled SGD. Our analysis discovers
  that cyclic client participation can achieve a faster asymptotic convergence rate
  than vanilla FedAvg with uniform client participation under suitable conditions,
  providing valuable insights into the design of client sampling protocols.
