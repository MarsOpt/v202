title: 'Probabilistic Unrolling: Scalable, Inverse-Free Maximum Likelihood Estimation
  for Latent Gaussian Models'
openreview: occOHdHWRn
abstract: Latent Gaussian models have a rich history in statistics and machine learning,
  with applications ranging from factor analysis to compressed sensing to time series
  analysis. The classical method for maximizing the likelihood of these models is
  the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. For problems with high-dimensional
  latent variables and large datasets, EM scales poorly because it needs to invert
  as many large covariance matrices as the number of data points. We introduce probabilistic
  unrolling, a method that combines Monte Carlo sampling with iterative linear solvers
  to circumvent matrix inversion. Our theoretical analyses reveal that unrolling and
  backpropagation through the iterations of the solver can accelerate gradient estimation
  for maximum likelihood estimation. In experiments on simulated and real data, we
  demonstrate that probabilistic unrolling learns latent Gaussian models up to an
  order of magnitude faster than gradient EM, with minimal losses in model performance.
