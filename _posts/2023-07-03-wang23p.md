title: Learning Belief Representations for Partially Observable Deep RL
openreview: 4IzEmHLono
abstract: 'Many important real-world Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems involve
  partial observability and require policies with memory. Unfortunately, standard
  deep RL algorithms for partially observable settings typically condition on the
  full history of interactions and are notoriously difficult to train. We propose
  a novel deep, partially observable RL algorithm based on modelling belief states
  â€” a technique typically used when solving tabular POMDPs, but that has traditionally
  been difficult to apply to more complex environments. Our approach simplifies policy
  learning by leveraging state information at training time, that may not be available
  at deployment time. We do so in two ways: first, we decouple belief state modelling
  (via unsupervised learning) from policy optimization (via RL); and second, we propose
  a representation learning approach to capture a compact set of reward-relevant features
  of the state. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on partially
  observable domains requiring information seeking and long-term memory.'
