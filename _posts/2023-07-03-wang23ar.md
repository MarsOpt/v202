title: 'DualHSIC: HSIC-Bottleneck and Alignment for Continual Learning'
openreview: Fm5wBnahGR
abstract: 'Rehearsal-based approaches are a mainstay of continual learning (CL). They
  mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem by maintaining a small fixed-size buffer
  with a subset of data from past tasks. While most rehearsal-based approaches exploit
  the knowledge from buffered past data, little attention is paid to inter-task relationships
  and to critical task-specific and task-invariant knowledge. By appropriately leveraging
  inter-task relationships, we propose a novel CL method, named DualHSIC, to boost
  the performance of existing rehearsal-based methods in a simple yet effective way.
  DualHSIC consists of two complementary components that stem from the so-called Hilbert
  Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC): HSIC-Bottleneck for Rehearsal (HBR) lessens
  the inter-task interference and HSIC Alignment (HA) promotes task-invariant knowledge
  sharing. Extensive experiments show that DualHSIC can be seamlessly plugged into
  existing rehearsal-based methods for consistent performance improvements, outperforming
  recent state-of-the-art regularization-enhanced rehearsal methods.'
