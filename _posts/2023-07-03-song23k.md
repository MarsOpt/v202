title: Loss-Guided Diffusion Models for Plug-and-Play Controllable Generation
openreview: JzZ2xAvCs8
abstract: We consider guiding denoising diffusion models with general differentiable
  loss functions in a plug-and-play fashion, enabling controllable generation without
  additional training. This paradigm, termed Loss-Guided Diffusion (LGD), can easily
  be integrated into all diffusion models and leverage various efficient samplers.
  Despite the benefits, the resulting guidance term is, unfortunately, an intractable
  integral and needs to be approximated. Existing methods compute the guidance term
  based on a point estimate. However, we show that such approaches have significant
  errors over the scale of the approximations. To address this issue, we propose a
  Monte Carlo method that uses multiple samples from a suitable distribution to reduce
  bias. Our method is effective in various synthetic and real-world settings, including
  image super-resolution, text or label-conditional image generation, and controllable
  motion synthesis. Notably, we show how our method can be applied to control a pretrained
  motion diffusion model to follow certain paths and avoid obstacles that are proven
  challenging to prior methods.
