title: Generative Graph Dictionary Learning
openreview: vTSyiXwoPK
abstract: Dictionary learning, which approximates data samples by a set of shared
  atoms, is a fundamental task in representation learning. However, dictionary learning
  over graphs, namely graph dictionary learning (GDL), is much more challenging than
  vectorial data as graphs lie in disparate metric spaces. The sparse literature on
  GDL formulates the problem from the reconstructive view and often learns linear
  graph embeddings with a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Fused
  Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) Mixture Model named FraMe to address the GDL problem from
  the generative view. Equipped with the graph generation function based on the radial
  basis function kernel and FGW distance, FraMe generates nonlinear embedding spaces,
  which, as we theoretically proved, provide a good approximation of the original
  graph spaces. A fast solution is further proposed on top of the expectation-maximization
  algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the obtained node and graph embeddings, and our algorithm achieves significant
  improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.
