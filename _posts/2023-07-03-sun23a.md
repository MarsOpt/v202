title: Vector-Valued Control Variates
openreview: 0uhNUQmtFk
abstract: Control variates are variance reduction tools for Monte Carlo estimators.
  They can provide significant variance reduction, but usually require a large number
  of samples, which can be prohibitive when sampling or evaluating the integrand is
  computationally expensive. Furthermore, there are many scenarios where we need to
  compute multiple related integrals simultaneously or sequentially, which can further
  exacerbate computational costs. In this paper, we propose vector-valued control
  variates, an extension of control variates which can be used to reduce the variance
  of multiple Monte Carlo estimators jointly. This allows for the transfer of information
  across integration tasks, and hence reduces the need for a large number of samples.
  We focus on control variates based on kernel interpolants and our novel construction
  is obtained through a generalised Stein identity and the development of novel matrix-valued
  Stein reproducing kernels. We demonstrate our methodology on a range of problems
  including multifidelity modelling, Bayesian inference for dynamical systems, and
  model evidence computation through thermodynamic integration.
