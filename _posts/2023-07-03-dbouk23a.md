title: On the Robustness of Randomized Ensembles to Adversarial Perturbations
openreview: 2aytHX3LRf
abstract: 'Randomized ensemble classifiers (RECs), where one classifier is randomly
  selected during inference, have emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional
  ensembling methods for realizing adversarially robust classifiers with limited compute
  requirements. However, recent works have shown that existing methods for constructing
  RECs are more vulnerable than initially claimed, casting major doubts on their efficacy
  and prompting fundamental questions such as: "When are RECs useful?", "What are
  their limits?", and "How do we train them?". In this work, we first demystify RECs
  as we derive fundamental results regarding their theoretical limits, necessary and
  sufficient conditions for them to be useful, and more. Leveraging this new understanding,
  we propose a new boosting algorithm (BARRE) for training robust RECs, and empirically
  demonstrate its effectiveness at defending against strong $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded
  adversaries across various network architectures and datasets. Our code can be found
  at https://github.com/hsndbk4/BARRE.'
