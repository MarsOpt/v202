title: 'RLEG: Vision-Language Representation Learning with Diffusion-based Embedding
  Generation'
openreview: zBShO1Vmf0
abstract: Vision-language representation learning models (e.g., CLIP) have achieved
  state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks, which usually need large-scale
  training data to learn discriminative representation. Recent progress on generative
  diffusion models (e.g., DALL-E 2) has demonstrated that diverse high-quality samples
  can be synthesized by randomly sampling from generative distribution. By virtue
  of generative capability in this paper, we propose a novel vision-language Representation
  Learning method with diffusion-based Embedding Generation (RLEG), which exploits
  diffusion models to generate feature embedding online for learning effective vision-language
  representation. Specifically, we first adopt image and text encoders to extract
  the corresponding embeddings. Secondly, pretrained diffusion-based embedding generators
  are harnessed to transfer the embedding modality online between vision and language
  domains. The embeddings generated from the generators are then served as augmented
  embedding-level samples, which are applied to contrastive learning with the variant
  of the CLIP framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method could
  learn effective representation and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various
  tasks including image classification, image-text retrieval, object detection, semantic
  segmentation, and text-conditional image generation.
