title: Is Consensus Acceleration Possible in Decentralized Optimization over Slowly
  Time-Varying Networks?
openreview: DwDQNKF4oy
abstract: We consider decentralized optimization problems where one aims to minimize
  a sum of convex smooth objective functions distributed between nodes in the network.
  The links in the network can change from time to time. For the setting when the
  amount of changes is arbitrary, lower complexity bounds and corresponding optimal
  algorithms are known, and the consensus acceleration is not possible. However, in
  practice the magnitude of network changes may be limited. We derive lower complexity
  bounds for several regimes of velocity of networks changes. Moreover, we show how
  to obtain accelerated communication rates for a certain class of time-varying graphs
  using a specific consensus algorithm.
