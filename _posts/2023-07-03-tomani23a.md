title: 'Beyond In-Domain Scenarios: Robust Density-Aware Calibration'
openreview: taBCtI0m5Y
abstract: Calibrating deep learning models to yield uncertainty-aware predictions
  is crucial as deep neural networks get increasingly deployed in safety-critical
  applications. While existing post-hoc calibration methods achieve impressive results
  on in-domain test datasets, they are limited by their inability to yield reliable
  uncertainty estimates in domain-shift and out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. We aim
  to bridge this gap by proposing DAC, an accuracy-preserving as well as Density-Aware
  Calibration method based on k-nearest-neighbors (KNN). In contrast to existing post-hoc
  methods, we utilize hidden layers of classifiers as a source for uncertainty-related
  information and study their importance. We show that DAC is a generic method that
  can readily be combined with state-of-the-art post-hoc methods. DAC boosts the robustness
  of calibration performance in domain-shift and OOD, while maintaining excellent
  in-domain predictive uncertainty estimates. We demonstrate that DAC leads to consistently
  better calibration across a large number of model architectures, datasets, and metrics.
  Additionally, we show that DAC improves calibration substantially on recent large-scale
  neural networks pre-trained on vast amounts of data.
