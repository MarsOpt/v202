title: Variational Open-Domain Question Answering
openreview: ag7PhmxOsS
abstract: Retrieval-augmented models have proven to be effective in natural language
  processing tasks, yet there remains a lack of research on their optimization using
  variational inference. We introduce the Variational Open-Domain (VOD) framework
  for end-to-end training and evaluation of retrieval-augmented models, focusing on
  open-domain question answering and language modelling. The VOD objective, a self-normalized
  estimate of the Rényi variational bound, approximates the task marginal likelihood
  and is evaluated under samples drawn from an auxiliary sampling distribution (cached
  retriever and/or approximate posterior). It remains tractable, even for retriever
  distributions defined on large corpora. We demonstrate VOD’s versatility by training
  reader-retriever BERT-sized models on multiple-choice medical exam questions. On
  the MedMCQA dataset, we outperform the domain-tuned Med-PaLM by +5.3% despite using
  2.500$\times$ fewer parameters. Our retrieval-augmented BioLinkBERT model scored
  62.9% on the MedMCQA and 55.0% on the MedQA-USMLE. Last, we show the effectiveness
  of our learned retriever component in the context of medical semantic search.
