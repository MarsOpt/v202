title: 'Open-VCLIP: Transforming CLIP to an Open-vocabulary Video Model via Interpolated
  Weight Optimization'
openreview: bj4XknLFIN
abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated impressive
  zero-shot learning abilities for image understanding, yet limited effort has been
  made to investigate CLIP for zero-shot video recognition. We introduce Open-VCLIP,
  a simple yet effective approach that transforms CLIP into a strong zero-shot video
  classifier that can recognize unseen actions and events at test time. Our framework
  extends CLIP with minimal modifications to model spatial-temporal relationships
  in videos, making it a specialized video classifier, while striving for generalization.
  We formally show that training an Open-VCLIP is equivalent to continual learning
  with zero historical data. To address this problem, we propose Interpolated Weight
  Optimization, which utilizes the benefit of weight interpolation in both training
  and test time. We evaluate our method on three popular and challenging action recognition
  datasets following various zero-shot evaluation protocols and we demonstrate our
  approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by clear margins. In particular, we
  achieve 87.9%, 58.3%, 81.1% zero-shot accuracy on UCF, HMDB and Kinetics-600 respectively,
  outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8.3%, 7.8% and 12.2%. Code is released
  at https://github.com/wengzejia1/Open-VCLIP.
