title: 'PFNs4BO: In-Context Learning for Bayesian Optimization'
openreview: 1DP5fR3iTr
abstract: 'In this paper, we use Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) as a flexible surrogate
  for Bayesian Optimization (BO). PFNs are neural processes that are trained to approximate
  the posterior predictive distribution (PPD) through in-context learning on any prior
  distribution that can be efficiently sampled from. We describe how this flexibility
  can be exploited for surrogate modeling in BO. We use PFNs to mimic a naive Gaussian
  process (GP), an advanced GP, and a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). In addition,
  we show how to incorporate further information into the prior, such as allowing
  hints about the position of optima (user priors), ignoring irrelevant dimensions,
  and performing non-myopic BO by learning the acquisition function. The flexibility
  underlying these extensions opens up vast possibilities for using PFNs for BO. We
  demonstrate the usefulness of PFNs for BO in a large-scale evaluation on artificial
  GP samples and three different hyperparameter optimization testbeds: HPO-B, Bayesmark,
  and PD1. We publish code alongside trained models at https://github.com/automl/PFNs4BO.'
