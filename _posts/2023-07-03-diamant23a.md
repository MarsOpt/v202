title: Improving Graph Generation by Restricting Graph Bandwidth
openreview: 9WJsVG58YO
abstract: Deep graph generative modeling has proven capable of learning the distribution
  of complex, multi-scale structures characterizing real-world graphs. However, one
  of the main limitations of existing methods is their large output space, which limits
  generation scalability and hinders accurate modeling of the underlying distribution.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that significantly reduces
  the output space of existing graph generative models. Specifically, starting from
  the observation that many real-world graphs have low graph bandwidth, we restrict
  graph bandwidth during training and generation. Our strategy improves both generation
  scalability and quality without increasing architectural complexity or reducing
  expressiveness. Our approach is compatible with existing graph generative methods,
  and we describe its application to both autoregressive and one-shot models. We extensively
  validate our strategy on synthetic and real datasets, including molecular graphs.
  Our experiments show that, in addition to improving generation efficiency, our approach
  consistently improves generation quality and reconstruction accuracy. The implementation
  is made available.
