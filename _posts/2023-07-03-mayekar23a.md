title: Communication-Constrained Bandits under Additive Gaussian Noise
openreview: sHlxJIWfZb
abstract: We study a distributed stochastic multi-armed bandit where a client supplies
  the learner with communication-constrained feedback based on the rewards for the
  corresponding arm pulls. In our setup, the client must encode the rewards such that
  the second moment of the encoded rewards is no more than $P$, and this encoded reward
  is further corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of variance $\sigma^2$; the learner
  only has access to this corrupted reward. For this setting, we derive an information-theoretic
  lower bound of $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{KT}{\mathtt{SNR} \wedge1}} \right)$ on the
  minimax regret of any scheme, where $\mathtt{SNR}\coloneqq \frac{P}{\sigma^2}$,
  and $K$ and $T$ are the number of arms and time horizon, respectively. Furthermore,
  we propose a multi-phase bandit algorithm, $\mathtt{UE}\text{-}\mathtt{UCB}\text{++}$,
  which matches this lower bound to a minor additive factor. $\mathtt{UE}\text{-}\mathtt{UCB}\text{++}$
  performs uniform exploration in its initial phases and then utilizes the <em>upper
  confidence bound </em>(UCB) bandit algorithm in its final phase. An interesting
  feature of $\mathtt{UE}\text{-}\mathtt{UCB}\text{++}$ is that the coarser estimates
  of the mean rewards formed during a uniform exploration phase help to refine the
  encoding protocol in the next phase, leading to more accurate mean estimates of
  the rewards in the subsequent phase. This positive reinforcement cycle is critical
  to reducing the number of uniform exploration rounds and closely matching our lower
  bound.
