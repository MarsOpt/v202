title: 'FREDIS: A Fusion Framework of Refinement and Disambiguation for Unreliable
  Partial Label Learning'
openreview: BAcj3gDlWV
abstract: To reduce the difficulty of annotation, partial label learning (PLL) has
  been widely studied, where each example is ambiguously annotated with a set of candidate
  labels instead of the exact correct label. PLL assumes that the candidate label
  set contains the correct label, which induces disambiguation, i.e., identification
  of the correct label in the candidate label set, adopted in most PLL methods. However,
  this assumption is impractical as no one could guarantee the existence of the correct
  label in the candidate label set under real-world scenarios. Therefore, Unreliable
  Partial Label Learning (UPLL) is investigated where the correct label of each example
  may not exist in the candidate label set. In this paper, we propose a fusion framework
  of refinement and disambiguation named FREDIS to handle the UPLL problem. Specifically,
  with theoretical guarantees, not only does disambiguation move incorrect labels
  from candidate labels to non-candidate labels but also refinement, an opposite procedure,
  moves correct labels from non-candidate labels to candidate labels. Besides, we
  prove that the classifier trained by our framework could eventually approximate
  the Bayes optimal classifier. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets
  validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
