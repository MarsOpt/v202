title: Feature Programming for Multivariate Time Series Prediction
openreview: LVARH5wXM9
abstract: We introduce the concept of programmable feature engineering for time series
  modeling and propose a feature programming framework. This framework generates large
  amounts of predictive features for noisy multivariate time series while allowing
  users to incorporate their inductive bias with minimal effort. The key motivation
  of our framework is to view any multivariate time series as a cumulative sum of
  fine-grained trajectory increments, with each increment governed by a novel spin-gas
  dynamical Ising model. This fine-grained perspective motivates the development of
  a parsimonious set of operators that summarize multivariate time series in an abstract
  fashion, serving as the foundation for large-scale automated feature engineering.
  Numerically, we validate the efficacy of our method on several synthetic and real-world
  noisy time series datasets.
