title: Scaling Laws for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation
openreview: SVCYSBgFIr
abstract: In this work, we provide a large-scale empirical study of the scaling properties
  of multilingual neural machine translation models. We examine how increases in the
  model size affect the model performance and investigate the role of the individual
  language pair weights on the scaling behavior. We find that these weights only affect
  the multiplicative factor of the scaling law, and in particular, the scaling exponent
  is unaffected by them. Through a novel joint scaling law formulation, we compute
  the effective number of parameters allocated to each language pair and examine the
  role of language similarity in the scaling behavior of our models. We find little
  evidence that language similarity has any impact. In contrast, “direction” of the
  multilinguality plays a significant role, with models translating from multiple
  languages into English having a larger number of effective parameters per task than
  their reversed counterparts. Finally, we leverage our observations to predict the
  performance of multilingual models trained with any language weighting at any scale,
  greatly reducing efforts required for language balancing in large multilingual models.
  Our findings apply to both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets and to multiple
  evaluation metrics, such as ChrF and BLEURT.
