title: Learning Subpocket Prototypes for Generalizable Structure-based Drug Design
openreview: gfdK6nK8AI
abstract: Generating molecules with high binding affinities to target proteins (a.k.a.
  structure-based drug design) is a fundamental and challenging task in drug discovery.
  Recently, deep generative models have achieved remarkable success in generating
  3D molecules conditioned on the protein pocket. However, most existing methods consider
  molecular generation for protein pockets independently while neglecting the underlying
  connections such as subpocket-level similarities. Subpockets are the local protein
  environments of ligand fragments and pockets with similar subpockets may bind the
  same molecular fragment (motif) even though their overall structures are different.
  Therefore, the trained models can hardly generalize to unseen protein pockets in
  real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method DrugGPS for generalizable
  structure-based drug design. With the biochemical priors, we propose to learn subpocket
  prototypes and construct a global interaction graph to model the interactions between
  subpocket prototypes and molecular motifs. Moreover, a hierarchical graph transformer
  encoder and motif-based 3D molecule generation scheme are used to improve the modelâ€™s
  performance. The experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms
  baselines in generating realistic drug candidates with high affinities in challenging
  out-of-distribution settings.
