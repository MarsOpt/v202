title: Distributional Offline Policy Evaluation with Predictive Error Guarantees
openreview: 3PZu2GPl64
abstract: We study the problem of estimating the distribution of the return of a policy
  using an offline dataset that is not generated from the policy, i.e., distributional
  offline policy evaluation (OPE). We propose an algorithm called Fitted Likelihood
  Estimation (FLE), which conducts a sequence of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
  and has the flexibility of integrating any state-of-the-art probabilistic generative
  models as long as it can be trained via MLE. FLE can be used for both finite-horizon
  and infinite-horizon discounted settings where rewards can be multi-dimensional
  vectors. Our theoretical results show that for both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon
  discounted settings, FLE can learn distributions that are close to the ground truth
  under total variation distance and Wasserstein distance, respectively. Our theoretical
  results hold under the conditions that the offline data covers the test policyâ€™s
  traces and that the supervised learning MLE procedures succeed. Experimentally,
  we demonstrate the performance of FLE with two generative models, Gaussian mixture
  models and diffusion models. For the multi-dimensional reward setting, FLE with
  diffusion models is capable of estimating the complicated distribution of the return
  of a test policy.
