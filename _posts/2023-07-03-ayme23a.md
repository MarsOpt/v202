title: Naive imputation implicitly regularizes high-dimensional linear models
openreview: gfSLvfVf0w
abstract: 'Two different approaches exist to handle missing values for prediction:
  either imputation, prior to fitting any predictive algorithms, or dedicated methods
  able to natively incorporate missing values. While imputation is widely (and easily)
  use, it is unfortunately biased when low-capacity predictors (such as linear models)
  are applied afterward. However, in practice, naive imputation exhibits good predictive
  performance. In this paper, we study the impact of imputation in a high-dimensional
  linear model with MCAR missing data. We prove that zero imputation performs an implicit
  regularization closely related to the ridge method, often used in high-dimensional
  problems. Leveraging on this connection, we establish that the imputation bias is
  controlled by a ridge bias, which vanishes in high dimension. As a predictor, we
  argue in favor of the averaged SGD strategy, applied to zero-imputed data. We establish
  an upper bound on its generalization error, highlighting that imputation is benign
  in the $d \gg \sqrt{n}$ regime. Experiments illustrate our findings.'
