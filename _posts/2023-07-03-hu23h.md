title: For Pre-Trained Vision Models in Motor Control, Not All Policy Learning Methods
  are Created Equal
openreview: s1p7IPgyyg
abstract: In recent years, increasing attention has been directed to leveraging pre-trained
  vision models for motor control. While existing works mainly emphasize the importance
  of this pre-training phase, the arguably equally important role played by downstream
  policy learning during control-specific fine-tuning is often neglected. It thus
  remains unclear if pre-trained vision models are consistent in their effectiveness
  under different control policies. To bridge this gap in understanding, we conduct
  a comprehensive study on 14 pre-trained vision models using 3 distinct classes of
  policy learning methods, including reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning
  through behavior cloning (BC), and imitation learning with a visual reward function
  (VRF). Our study yields a series of intriguing results, including the discovery
  that the effectiveness of pre-training is highly dependent on the choice of the
  downstream policy learning algorithm. We show that conventionally accepted evaluation
  based on RL methods is highly variable and therefore unreliable, and further advocate
  for using more robust methods like VRF and BC. To facilitate more universal evaluations
  of pre-trained models and their policy learning methods in the future, we also release
  a benchmark of 21 tasks across 3 different environments alongside our work.
