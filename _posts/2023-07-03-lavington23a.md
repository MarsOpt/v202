title: Target-based Surrogates for Stochastic Optimization
openreview: QExVqoGknN
abstract: We consider minimizing functions for which it is expensive to compute the
  (possibly stochastic) gradient. Such functions are prevalent in reinforcement learning,
  imitation learning and adversarial training. Our target optimization framework uses
  the (expensive) gradient computation to construct surrogate functions in a <em>target
  space</em> (e.g. the logits output by a linear model for classification) that can
  be minimized efficiently. This allows for multiple parameter updates to the model,
  amortizing the cost of gradient computation. In the full-batch setting, we prove
  that our surrogate is a global upper-bound on the loss, and can be (locally) minimized
  using a black-box optimization algorithm. We prove that the resulting majorization-minimization
  algorithm ensures convergence to a stationary point of the loss. Next, we instantiate
  our framework in the stochastic setting and propose the $SSO$ algorithm, which can
  be viewed as projected stochastic gradient descent in the target space. This connection
  enables us to prove theoretical guarantees for $SSO$ when minimizing convex functions.
  Our framework allows the use of standard stochastic optimization algorithms to construct
  surrogates which can be minimized by any deterministic optimization method. To evaluate
  our framework, we consider a suite of supervised learning and imitation learning
  problems. Our experiments indicate the benefits of target optimization and the effectiveness
  of $SSO$.
