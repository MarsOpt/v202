title: A Gromov-Wasserstein Geometric View of Spectrum-Preserving Graph Coarsening
openreview: 8lCz8flXkr
abstract: Graph coarsening is a technique for solving large-scale graph problems by
  working on a smaller version of the original graph, and possibly interpolating the
  results back to the original graph. It has a long history in scientific computing
  and has recently gained popularity in machine learning, particularly in methods
  that preserve the graph spectrum. This work studies graph coarsening from a different
  perspective, developing a theory for preserving graph distances and proposing a
  method to achieve this. The geometric approach is useful when working with a collection
  of graphs, such as in graph classification and regression. In this study, we consider
  a graph as an element on a metric space equipped with the Gromovâ€“Wasserstein (GW)
  distance, and bound the difference between the distance of two graphs and their
  coarsened versions. Minimizing this difference can be done using the popular weighted
  kernel $K$-means method, which improves existing spectrum-preserving methods with
  the proper choice of the kernel. The study includes a set of experiments to support
  the theory and method, including approximating the GW distance, preserving the graph
  spectrum, classifying graphs using spectral information, and performing regression
  using graph convolutional networks. Code is available at https://github.com/ychen-stat-ml/GW-Graph-Coarsening.
