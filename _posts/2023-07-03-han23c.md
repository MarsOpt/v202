title: Alternately Optimized Graph Neural Networks
openreview: 2tDZSYxMup
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have greatly advanced the semi-supervised node
  classification task on graphs. The majority of existing GNNs are trained in an end-to-end
  manner that can be viewed as tackling a bi-level optimization problem. This process
  is often inefficient in computation and memory usage. In this work, we propose a
  new optimization framework for semi-supervised learning on graphs from a multi-view
  learning perspective. The proposed framework can be conveniently solved by the alternating
  optimization algorithms, resulting in significantly improved efficiency. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable or better
  performance with state-of-the-art baselines while it has significantly better computation
  and memory efficiency.
