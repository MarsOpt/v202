title: Off-Policy Evaluation for Large Action Spaces via Conjunct Effect Modeling
openreview: rK45lWksZ9
abstract: We study off-policy evaluation (OPE) of contextual bandit policies for large
  discrete action spaces where conventional importance-weighting approaches suffer
  from excessive variance. To circumvent this variance issue, we propose a new estimator,
  called <em>OffCEM</em>, that is based on the <em>conjunct effect model</em> (CEM),
  a novel decomposition of the causal effect into a cluster effect and a residual
  effect. OffCEM applies importance weighting only to action clusters and addresses
  the residual causal effect through model-based reward estimation. We show that the
  proposed estimator is unbiased under a new assumption, called <em>local correctness</em>,
  which only requires that the residual-effect model preserves the relative expected
  reward differences of the actions within each cluster. To best leverage the CEM
  and local correctness, we also propose a new two-step procedure for performing model-based
  estimation that minimizes bias in the first step and variance in the second step.
  We find that the resulting OffCEM estimator substantially improves bias and variance
  compared to a range of conventional estimators. Experiments demonstrate that OffCEM
  provides substantial improvements in OPE especially in the presence of many actions.
