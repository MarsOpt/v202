title: 'AdaNPC: Exploring Non-Parametric Classifier for Test-Time Adaptation'
openreview: 2DiZF15Kgc
abstract: Many recent machine learning tasks focus to develop models that can generalize
  to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG) has become one of the key topics
  in various fields. Several literatures show that DG can be arbitrarily hard without
  exploiting target domain information. To address this issue, test-time adaptive
  (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods require offline target data or
  extra sophisticated optimization procedures during the inference stage. In this
  work, we adopt <b>N</b>on-<b>P</b>arametric <b>C</b>lassifier to perform the test-time
  <b>Ada</b>ptation (<b>AdaNPC</b>). In particular, we construct a memory that contains
  the feature and label pairs from training domains. During inference, given a test
  instance, AdaNPC first recalls $k$ closed samples from the memory to vote for the
  prediction, and then the test feature and predicted label are added to the memory.
  In this way, the sample distribution in the memory can be gradually changed from
  the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation
  cost. We theoretically justify the rationality behind the proposed method. Besides,
  we test our model on extensive numerical experiments. AdaNPC significantly outperforms
  competitive baselines on various DG benchmarks. In particular, when the adaptation
  target is a series of domains, the adaptation accuracy of AdaNPC is $50$% higher
  than advanced TTA methods.
