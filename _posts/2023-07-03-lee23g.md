title: 'Pix2Struct: Screenshot Parsing as Pretraining for Visual Language Understanding'
openreview: bF1LVbP493
abstract: 'Visually-situated language is ubiquitousâ€”sources range from textbooks with
  diagrams to web pages with images and tables, to mobile apps with buttons and forms.
  Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domain-specific
  recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures, and objectives.
  We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for purely visual language
  understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language.
  Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse masked screenshots of web pages into
  simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected
  in the HTML structure, provides a large source of pretraining data well suited to
  the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining
  signals such as OCR, language modeling, and image captioning. In addition to the
  novel pretraining strategy, we introduce a variable-resolution input representation
  and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts
  such as questions are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first
  time, we show that a single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results
  in six out of nine tasks across four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces,
  and natural images.'
