title: A Mathematical Model for Curriculum Learning for Parities
openreview: EgRfH4jeTL
abstract: Curriculum learning (CL)- training using samples that are generated and
  presented in a meaningful order - was introduced in the machine learning context
  around a decade ago. While CL has been extensively used and analysed empirically,
  there has been very little mathematical justification for its advantages. We introduce
  a CL model for learning the class of k-parities on d bits of a binary string with
  a neural network trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We show that a wise
  choice of training examples, involving two or more product distributions, allows
  to reduce significantly the computational cost of learning this class of functions,
  compared to learning under the uniform distribution. We conduct experiments to support
  our analysis. Furthermore, we show that for another class of functions - namely
  the ‘Hamming mixtures’ - CL strategies involving a bounded number of product distributions
  are not beneficial.
