title: 'FLEX: an Adaptive Exploration Algorithm for Nonlinear Systems'
openreview: j9q5fadNpg
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning is a powerful tool, but collecting data
  to fit an accurate model of the system can be costly. Exploring an unknown environment
  in a sample-efficient manner is hence of great importance. However, the complexity
  of dynamics and the computational limitations of real systems make this task challenging.
  In this work, we introduce FLEX, an exploration algorithm for nonlinear dynamics
  based on optimal experimental design. Our policy maximizes the information of the
  next step and results in an adaptive exploration algorithm, compatible with arbitrary
  parametric learning models, and requiring minimal computing resources. We test our
  method on a number of nonlinear environments covering different settings, including
  time-varying dynamics. Keeping in mind that exploration is intended to serve an
  exploitation objective, we also test our algorithm on downstream model-based classical
  control tasks and compare it to other state-of-the-art model-based and model-free
  approaches. The performance achieved by FLEX is competitive and its computational
  cost is low.
