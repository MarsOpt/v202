title: 'Bigger, Better, Faster: Human-level Atari with human-level efficiency'
openreview: 2sjm6AH1jB
abstract: We introduce a value-based RL agent, which we call BBF, that achieves super-human
  performance in the Atari 100K benchmark. BBF relies on scaling the neural networks
  used for value estimation, as well as a number of other design choices that enable
  this scaling in a sample-efficient manner. We conduct extensive analyses of these
  design choices and provide insights for future work. We end with a discussion about
  updating the goalposts for sample-efficient RL research on the ALE. We make our
  code and data publicly available at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/bigger_better_faster.
