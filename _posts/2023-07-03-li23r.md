title: Nearly Optimal Algorithms with Sublinear Computational Complexity for Online
  Kernel Regression
openreview: tuZFblOQOp
abstract: The trade-off between regret and computational cost is a fundamental problem
  for online kernel regression, and previous algorithms worked on the trade-off can
  not keep optimal regret bounds at a sublinear computational complexity. In this
  paper, we propose two new algorithms, AOGD-ALD and NONS-ALD, which can keep nearly
  optimal regret bounds at a sublinear computational complexity, and give sufficient
  conditions under which our algorithms work. Both algorithms dynamically maintain
  a group of nearly orthogonal basis used to approximate the kernel mapping, and keep
  nearly optimal regret bounds by controlling the approximate error. The number of
  basis depends on the approximate error and the decay rate of eigenvalues of the
  kernel matrix. If the eigenvalues decay exponentially, then AOGD-ALD and NONS-ALD
  separately achieves a regret of $O(\sqrt{L(f)})$ and $O(\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mu)\ln{T})$
  at a computational complexity in $O(\ln^2{T})$. If the eigenvalues decay polynomially
  with degree $p\geq 1$, then our algorithms keep the same regret bounds at a computational
  complexity in $o(T)$ in the case of $p>4$ and $p\geq 10$, respectively. $L(f)$ is
  the cumulative losses of $f$ and $\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mu)$ is the effective
  dimension of the problem. The two regret bounds are nearly optimal and are not comparable.
