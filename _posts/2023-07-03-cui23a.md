title: Rethinking Weak Supervision in Helping Contrastive Learning
openreview: 3Loamzk5Fm
abstract: Contrastive learning has shown outstanding performances in both supervised
  and unsupervised learning, and has recently been introduced to solve weakly supervised
  learning problems such as semi-supervised learning and noisy label learning. Despite
  the empirical evidence showing that semi-supervised labels improve the representations
  of contrastive learning, it remains unknown if noisy supervised information can
  be directly used in training instead of after manual denoising. Therefore, to explore
  the mechanical differences between semi-supervised and noisy-labeled information
  in helping contrastive learning, we establish a unified theoretical framework of
  contrastive learning under weak supervision. Specifically, we investigate the most
  intuitive paradigm of jointly training supervised and unsupervised contrastive losses.
  By translating the weakly supervised information into a similarity graph under the
  framework of spectral clustering based on the posterior probability of weak labels,
  we establish the downstream classification error bound. We prove that semi-supervised
  labels improve the downstream error bound whereas noisy labels have limited effects
  under such a paradigm. Our theoretical findings here provide new insights for the
  community to rethink the role of weak supervision in helping contrastive learning.
