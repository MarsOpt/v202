title: 'Generalized Reductions: Making any Hierarchical Clustering Fair and Balanced
  with Low Cost'
openreview: 15B0PeFscj
abstract: Clustering is a fundamental building block of modern statistical analysis
  pipelines. Fair clustering has seen much attention from the machine learning community
  in recent years. We are some of the first to study fairness in the context of hierarchical
  clustering, after the results of Ahmadian et al. from NeurIPS in 2020. We evaluate
  our results using Dasguptaâ€™s cost function, perhaps one of the most prevalent theoretical
  metrics for hierarchical clustering evaluation. Our work vastly improves the previous
  $O(n^{5/6}poly\log(n))$ fair approximation for cost to a near polylogarithmic $O(n^\delta
  poly\log(n))$ fair approximation for any constant $\delta\in(0,1)$. This result
  establishes a cost fairness tradeoff and extends to broader fairness constraints
  than the previous work. We also show how to alter existing hierarchical clusterings
  to guarantee fairness and cluster balance across any level in the hierarchy.
