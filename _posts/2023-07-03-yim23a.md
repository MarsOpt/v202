title: SE(3) diffusion model with application to protein backbone generation
openreview: m8OUBymxwv
abstract: The design of novel protein structures remains a challenge in protein engineering
  for applications across biomedicine and chemistry. In this line of work, a diffusion
  model over rigid bodies in 3D (referred to as frames) has shown success in generating
  novel, functional protein backbones that have not been observed in nature. However,
  there exists no principled methodological framework for diffusion on SE(3), the
  space of orientation preserving rigid motions in R3, that operates on frames and
  confers the group invariance. We address these shortcomings by developing theoretical
  foundations of SE(3) invariant diffusion models on multiple frames followed by a
  novel framework, FrameDiff, for estimating the SE(3) equivariant score over multiple
  frames. We apply FrameDiff on monomer backbone generation and find it can generate
  designable monomers up to 500 amino acids without relying on a pretrained protein
  structure prediction network that has been integral to previous methods. We find
  our samples are capable of generalizing beyond any known protein structure.
