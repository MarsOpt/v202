title: 'ED-Batch: Efficient Automatic Batching of Dynamic Neural Networks via Learned
  Finite State Machines'
openreview: CZxFOb5azq
abstract: Batching has a fundamental influence on the efficiency of deep neural network
  (DNN) execution. However, for dynamic DNNs, efficient batching is particularly challenging
  as the dataflow graph varies per input instance. As a result, state-of-the-art frameworks
  use heuristics that result in suboptimal batching decisions. Further, batching puts
  strict restrictions on memory adjacency and can lead to high data movement costs.
  In this paper, we provide an approach for batching dynamic DNNs based on finite
  state machines, which enables the automatic discovery of batching policies specialized
  for each DNN via reinforcement learning. Moreover, we find that memory planning
  that is aware of the batching policy can save significant data movement overheads,
  which is automated by a PQ tree-based algorithm we introduce. Experimental results
  show that our framework speeds up state-of-the-art frameworks by on average 1.15x,
  1.39x, and 2.45x for chain-based, tree-based, and lattice-based DNNs across CPU
  and GPU. The framework is open-sourced at https://github.com/gulang2019/ED-Batch.git.
