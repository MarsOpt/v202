title: 'Graph Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence on Large Graphs'
openreview: Dmac7fT3TS
abstract: 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve remarkable performance in graph machine
  learning tasks but can be hard to train on large-graph data, where their learning
  dynamics are not well understood. We investigate the training dynamics of large-graph
  GNNs using graph neural tangent kernels (GNTKs) and graphons. In the limit of large
  width, optimization of an overparametrized NN is equivalent to kernel regression
  on the NTK. Here, we investigate how the GNTK evolves as another independent dimension
  is varied: the graph size. We use graphons to define limit objects—graphon NNs for
  GNNs, and graphon NTKs for GNTKs—, and prove that, on a sequence of graphs, the
  GNTKs converge to the graphon NTK. We further prove that the spectrum of the GNTK,
  which is related to the problem’s learning directions, converges to the spectrum
  of the GNTK. This implies that in the large-graph limit, the GNTK fitted on a graph
  of moderate size can be used to solve the same task on the large graph, and to infer
  the learning dynamics of the large-graph GNN. These results are verified empirically
  on node regression and classification tasks.'
