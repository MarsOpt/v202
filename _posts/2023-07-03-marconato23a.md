title: 'Neuro-Symbolic Continual Learning: Knowledge, Reasoning Shortcuts and Concept
  Rehearsal'
openreview: QEHU2o2Q7h
abstract: 'We introduce Neuro-Symbolic Continual Learning, where a model has to solve
  a sequence of neuro-symbolic tasks, that is, it has to map sub-symbolic inputs to
  high-level concepts and compute predictions by reasoning consistently with prior
  knowledge. Our key observation is that neuro-symbolic tasks, although different,
  often share concepts whose semantics remains stable over time. Traditional approaches
  fall short: existing continual strategies ignore knowledge altogether, while stock
  neuro-symbolic architectures suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We show that leveraging
  prior knowledge by combining neuro-symbolic architectures with continual strategies
  does help avoid catastrophic forgetting, but also that doing so can yield models
  affected by reasoning shortcuts. These undermine the semantics of the acquired concepts,
  even when detailed prior knowledge is provided upfront and inference is exact, and
  in turn continual performance. To overcome these issues, we introduce COOL, a COncept-level
  cOntinual Learning strategy tailored for neuro-symbolic continual problems that
  acquires high-quality concepts and remembers them over time. Our experiments on
  three novel benchmarks highlights how COOL attains sustained high performance on
  neuro-symbolic continual learning tasks in which other strategies fail.'
