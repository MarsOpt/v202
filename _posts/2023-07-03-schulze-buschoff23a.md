title: The Acquisition of Physical Knowledge in Generative Neural Networks
openreview: C5lAsw1GCg
abstract: As children grow older, they develop an intuitive understanding of the physical
  processes around them. Their physical understanding develops in stages, moving along
  developmental trajectories which have been mapped out extensively in previous empirical
  research. Here, we investigate how the learning trajectories of deep generative
  neural networks compare to children’s developmental trajectories using physical
  understanding as a testbed. We outline an approach that allows us to examine two
  distinct hypotheses of human development – stochastic optimization and complexity
  increase. We find that while our models are able to accurately predict a number
  of physical processes, their learning trajectories under both hypotheses do not
  follow the developmental trajectories of children.
