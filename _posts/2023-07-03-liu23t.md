title: Causal Structure Learning for Latent Intervened Non-stationary Data
openreview: 0e2DfXKbwE
abstract: Causal structure learning can reveal the causal mechanism behind natural
  systems. It is well studied that the multiple domain data consisting of observational
  and interventional samples benefit causal identifiability. However, for non-stationary
  time series data, domain indexes are often unavailable, making it difficult to distinguish
  observational samples from interventional samples. To address these issues, we propose
  a novel Latent Intervened Non-stationary learning (LIN) method to make the domain
  indexes recovery process and the causal structure learning process mutually promote
  each other. We characterize and justify a possible faithfulness condition to guarantee
  the identifiability of the proposed LIN method. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines on
  causal structure learning for latent intervened non-stationary data.
