title: 'The Unintended Consequences of Discount Regularization: Improving Regularization
  in Certainty Equivalence Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: BEoppYS3SC
abstract: Discount regularization, using a shorter planning horizon when calculating
  the optimal policy, is a popular choice to restrict planning to a less complex set
  of policies when estimating an MDP from sparse or noisy data (Jiang et al., 2015).
  It is commonly understood that discount regularization functions by de-emphasizing
  or ignoring delayed effects. In this paper, we reveal an alternate view of discount
  regularization that exposes unintended consequences. We demonstrate that planning
  under a lower discount factor produces an identical optimal policy to planning using
  any prior on the transition matrix that has the same distribution for all states
  and actions. In fact, it functions like a prior with stronger regularization on
  state-action pairs with more transition data. This leads to poor performance when
  the transition matrix is estimated from data sets with uneven amounts of data across
  state-action pairs. Our equivalence theorem leads to an explicit formula to set
  regularization parameters locally for individual state-action pairs rather than
  globally. We demonstrate the failures of discount regularization and how we remedy
  them using our state-action-specific method across simple empirical examples as
  well as a medical cancer simulator.
