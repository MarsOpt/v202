title: Towards Omni-generalizable Neural Methods for Vehicle Routing Problems
openreview: PlFBOnVOFg
abstract: 'Learning heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has gained much
  attention due to the less reliance on hand-crafted rules. However, existing methods
  are typically trained and tested on the same task with a fixed size and distribution
  (of nodes), and hence suffer from limited generalization performance. This paper
  studies a challenging yet realistic setting, which considers generalization across
  both size and distribution in VRPs. We propose a generic meta-learning framework,
  which enables effective training of an initialized model with the capability of
  fast adaptation to new tasks during inference. We further develop a simple yet efficient
  approximation method to reduce the training overhead. Extensive experiments on both
  synthetic and benchmark instances of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and capacitated
  vehicle routing problem (CVRP) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
