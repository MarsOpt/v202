title: 'FusionRetro: Molecule Representation Fusion via In-Context Learning for Retrosynthetic
  Planning'
openreview: cnILy0dQUr
abstract: 'Retrosynthetic planning aims to devise a complete multi-step synthetic
  route from starting materials to a target molecule. Current strategies use a decoupled
  approach of single-step retrosynthesis models and search algorithms, taking only
  the product as the input to predict the reactants for each planning step and ignoring
  valuable context information along the synthetic route. In this work, we propose
  a novel framework that utilizes context information for improved retrosynthetic
  planning. We view synthetic routes as reaction graphs and propose to incorporate
  context through three principled steps: encode molecules into embeddings, aggregate
  information over routes, and readout to predict reactants. Our approach is the first
  attempt to utilize in-context learning for retrosynthesis prediction in retrosynthetic
  planning. The entire framework can be efficiently optimized in an end-to-end fashion
  and produce more practical and accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
  that by fusing in the context information over routes, our model significantly improves
  the performance of retrosynthetic planning over baselines that are not context-aware,
  especially for long synthetic routes. Code is available at https://github.com/SongtaoLiu0823/FusionRetro.'
