title: Multi-Objective Population Based Training
openreview: 79sTydcg7o
abstract: Population Based Training (PBT) is an efficient hyperparameter optimization
  algorithm. PBT is a single-objective algorithm, but many real-world hyperparameter
  optimization problems involve two or more conflicting objectives. In this work,
  we therefore introduce a multi-objective version of PBT, MO-PBT. Our experiments
  on diverse multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problems (Precision/Recall,
  Accuracy/Fairness, Accuracy/Adversarial Robustness) show that MO-PBT outperforms
  random search, single-objective PBT, and the state-of-the-art multi-objective hyperparameter
  optimization algorithm MO-ASHA.
