title: Fast Rates for Maximum Entropy Exploration
openreview: wcUppxYfLH
abstract: We address the challenge of exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) when
  the agent operates in an unknown environment with sparse or no rewards. In this
  work, we study the maximum entropy exploration problem of two different types. The
  first type is visitation entropy maximization previously considered by Hazan et
  al. (2019) in the discounted setting. For this type of exploration, we propose a
  game-theoretic algorithm that has $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^3S^2A/\varepsilon^2)$
  sample complexity thus improving the $\varepsilon$-dependence upon existing results,
  where $S$ is a number of states, $A$ is a number of actions, $H$ is an episode length,
  and $\varepsilon$ is a desired accuracy. The second type of entropy we study is
  the trajectory entropy. This objective function is closely related to the entropy-regularized
  MDPs, and we propose a simple algorithm that has a sample complexity of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(S,A,H)/\varepsilon)$.
  Interestingly, it is the first theoretical result in RL literature that establishes
  the potential statistical advantage of regularized MDPs for exploration. Finally,
  we apply developed regularization techniques to reduce sample complexity of visitation
  entropy maximization to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^2SA/\varepsilon^2)$, yielding
  a statistical separation between maximum entropy exploration and reward-free exploration.
