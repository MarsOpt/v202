title: 'Horizon-free Learning for Markov Decision Processes and Games: Stochastically
  Bounded Rewards and Improved Bounds'
openreview: usSPcB8gwI
abstract: Horizon dependence is an important difference between reinforcement learning
  and other machine learning paradigms. Yet, existing results tackling the (exact)
  horizon dependence either assume that the reward is bounded per step, introducing
  unfair comparison, or assume strict total boundedness that requires the sum of rewards
  to be bounded <em>almost surely</em> – allowing only restricted noise on the reward
  observation. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a new relaxation
  – <em>expected boundedness</em> on rewards, where we allow the reward to be stochastic
  with only boundedness on the <em>expected</em> sum – opening the door to study horizon-dependence
  with a much broader set of reward functions with noises. We establish a novel generic
  algorithm that achieves <em>no-horizon dependence</em> in terms of sample complexity
  for both Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Games, via reduction to a good-conditioned
  <em>auxiliary Markovian environment</em>, in which only “important” state-action
  pairs are preserved. The algorithm takes only $\tilde{O}(\frac{S^2A}{\epsilon^2})$
  episodes interacting with such an environment to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal policy/strategy
  (with high probability), improving (zhang, 2022) (which only applies to MDPs with
  deterministic rewards). Here $S$ is the number of states and $A$ is the number of
  actions, and the bound is independent of the horizon $H$.
