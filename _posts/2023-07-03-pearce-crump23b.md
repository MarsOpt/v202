title: How Jellyfish Characterise Alternating Group Equivariant Neural Networks
openreview: MORCsaQjR7
abstract: We provide a full characterisation of all of the possible alternating group
  ($A_n$) equivariant neural networks whose layers are some tensor power of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
  In particular, we find a basis of matrices for the learnable, linear, $A_n$â€“equivariant
  layer functions between such tensor power spaces in the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
  We also describe how our approach generalises to the construction of neural networks
  that are equivariant to local symmetries.
