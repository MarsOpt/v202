title: 'Multi-Symmetry Ensembles: Improving Diversity and Generalization via Opposing
  Symmetries'
openreview: Lbc00McvMC
abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have been successful in improving model performance
  by learning diverse members via the stochasticity of random initialization. While
  recent works have attempted to promote further diversity in DE via hyperparameters
  or regularizing loss functions, these methods primarily still rely on a stochastic
  approach to explore the hypothesis space. In this work, we present Multi-Symmetry
  Ensembles (MSE), a framework for constructing diverse ensembles by capturing the
  multiplicity of hypotheses along symmetry axes, which explore the hypothesis space
  beyond stochastic perturbations of model weights and hyperparameters. We leverage
  recent advances in contrastive representation learning to create models that separately
  capture opposing hypotheses of invariant and equivariant functional classes and
  present a simple ensembling approach to efficiently combine appropriate hypotheses
  for a given task. We show that MSE effectively captures the multiplicity of conflicting
  hypotheses that is often required in large, diverse datasets like ImageNet. As a
  result of their inherent diversity, MSE improves classification performance, uncertainty
  quantification, and generalization across a series of transfer tasks. Our code is
