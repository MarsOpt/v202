title: In Search for a Generalizable Method for Source Free Domain Adaptation
openreview: Yh9sFZQk7Y
abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is compelling because it allows adapting
  an off-the-shelf model to a new domain using only unlabelled data. In this work,
  we apply existing SFDA techniques to a challenging set of naturally-occurring distribution
  shifts in bioacoustics, which are very different from the ones commonly studied
  in computer vision. We find existing methods perform differently relative to each
  other than observed in vision benchmarks, and sometimes perform worse than no adaptation
  at all. We propose a new simple method which outperforms the existing methods on
  our new shifts while exhibiting strong performance on a range of vision datasets.
  Our findings suggest that existing SFDA methods are not as generalizable as previously
  thought and that considering diverse modalities can be a useful avenue for designing
  more robust models.
