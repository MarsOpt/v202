title: 'Discover and Cure: Concept-aware Mitigation of Spurious Correlation'
openreview: QDxtrlPmfB
abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations to make predictions,
  which hinders generalization beyond training environments. For instance, models
  that associate cats with bed backgrounds can fail to predict the existence of cats
  in other environments without beds. Mitigating spurious correlations is crucial
  in building trustworthy models. However, the existing works lack transparency to
  offer insights into the mitigation process. In this work, we propose an interpretable
  framework, Discover and Cure (DISC), to tackle the issue. With human-interpretable
  concepts, DISC iteratively 1) discovers unstable concepts across different environments
  as spurious attributes, then 2) intervenes on the training data using the discovered
  concepts to reduce spurious correlation. Across systematic experiments, DISC provides
  superior generalization ability and interpretability than the existing approaches.
  Specifically, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on an object recognition
  task and a skin-lesion classification task by 7.5% and 9.6%, respectively. Additionally,
  we offer theoretical analysis and guarantees to understand the benefits of models
  trained by DISC. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Wuyxin/DISC.
