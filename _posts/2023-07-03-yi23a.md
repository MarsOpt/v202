title: Doubly Adversarial Federated Bandits
openreview: FjOB0g7iRf
abstract: 'We study a new non-stochastic federated multiarmed bandit problem with
  multiple agents collaborating via a communication network. The losses of the arms
  are assigned by an oblivious adversary that specifies the loss of each arm not only
  for each time step but also for each agent, which we call doubly adversarial. In
  this setting, different agents may choose the same arm in the same time step but
  observe different feedback. The goal of each agent is to find a globally best arm
  in hindsight that has the lowest cumulative loss averaged over all agents, which
  necessities the communication among agents. We provide regret lower bounds for any
  federated bandit algorithm under different settings, when agents have access to
  full-information feedback, or the bandit feedback. For the bandit feedback setting,
  we propose a near-optimal federated bandit algorithm called FEDEXP3. Our algorithm
  gives a positive answer to an open question proposed in (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2016):
  FEDEXP3 can guarantee a sub-linear regret without exchanging sequences of selected
  arm identities or loss sequences among agents. We also provide numerical evaluations
  of our algorithm to validate our theoretical results and demonstrate its effectiveness
  on synthetic and real-world datasets.'
