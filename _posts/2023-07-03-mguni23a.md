title: 'MANSA: Learning Fast and Slow in Multi-Agent Systems'
openreview: VLoypBbG3t
abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), independent learning (IL)
  often shows remarkable performance and easily scales with the number of agents.
  Yet, using IL can be inefficient and runs the risk of failing to successfully train,
  particularly in scenarios that require agents to coordinate their actions. Using
  centralised learning (CL) enables MARL agents to quickly learn how to coordinate
  their behaviour but employing CL everywhere is often prohibitively expensive in
  real-world applications. Besides, using CL in value-based methods often needs strong
  representational constraints (e.g. individual-global-max condition) that can lead
  to poor performance if violated. In this paper, we introduce a novel plug & play
  IL framework named Multi-Agent Network Selection Algorithm (MANSA) which selectively
  employs CL only at states that require coordination. At its core, MANSA has an additional
  agent that uses switching controls to quickly learn the best states to activate
  CL during training, using CL only where necessary and vastly reducing the computational
  burden of CL. Our theory proves MANSA preserves cooperative MARL convergence properties,
  boosts IL performance and can optimally make use of a fixed budget on the number
  CL calls. We show empirically in Level-based Foraging (LBF) and StarCraft Multi-agent
  Challenge (SMAC) that MANSA achieves fast, superior and more reliable performance
  while making 40% fewer CL calls in SMAC and using CL at only 1% CL calls in LBF.
