title: High-dimensional Location Estimation via Norm Concentration for Subgamma Vectors
openreview: wGgIcftFzm
abstract: In location estimation, we are given $n$ samples from a known distribution
  $f$ shifted by an unknown translation $\lambda$, and want to estimate $\lambda$
  as precisely as possible. Asymptotically, the maximum likelihood estimate achieves
  the Cramér-Rao bound of error $\mathcal N(0, \frac{1}{n\mathcal I})$, where $\mathcal
  I$ is the Fisher information of $f$. However, the $n$ required for convergence depends
  on $f$, and may be arbitrarily large. We build on the theory using <em>smoothed</em>
  estimators to bound the error for finite $n$ in terms of $\mathcal I_r$, the Fisher
  information of the $r$-smoothed distribution. As $n \to \infty$, $r \to 0$ at an
  explicit rate and this converges to the Cramér-Rao bound. We (1) improve the prior
  work for 1-dimensional $f$ to converge for constant failure probability in addition
  to high probability, and (2) extend the theory to high-dimensional distributions.
  In the process, we prove a new bound on the norm of a high-dimensional random variable
  whose 1-dimensional projections are subgamma, which may be of independent interest.
