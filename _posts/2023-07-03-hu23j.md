title: Understanding the Impact of Adversarial Robustness on Accuracy Disparity
openreview: 3aauzk8QUl
abstract: 'While it has long been empirically observed that adversarial robustness
  may be at odds with standard accuracy and may have further disparate impacts on
  different classes, it remains an open question to what extent such observations
  hold and how the class imbalance plays a role within. In this paper, we attempt
  to understand this question of accuracy disparity by taking a closer look at linear
  classifiers under a Gaussian mixture model. We decompose the impact of adversarial
  robustness into two parts: an inherent effect that will degrade the standard accuracy
  on all classes due to the robustness constraint, and the other caused by the class
  imbalance ratio, which will increase the accuracy disparity compared to standard
  training. Furthermore, we also show that such effects extend beyond the Gaussian
  mixture model, by generalizing our data model to the general family of stable distributions.
  More specifically, we demonstrate that while the constraint of adversarial robustness
  consistently degrades the standard accuracy in the balanced class setting, the class
  imbalance ratio plays a fundamentally different role in accuracy disparity compared
  to the Gaussian case, due to the heavy tail of the stable distribution. We additionally
  perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to corroborate our
  theoretical findings. Our empirical results also suggest that the implications may
  extend to nonlinear models over real-world datasets. Our code is publicly available
  on GitHub at https://github.com/Accuracy-Disparity/AT-on-AD.'
