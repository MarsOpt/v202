title: Model-agnostic Measure of Generalization Difficulty
openreview: jQjteeywiR
abstract: The measure of a machine learning algorithm is the difficulty of the tasks
  it can perform, and sufficiently difficult tasks are critical drivers of strong
  machine learning models. However, quantifying the generalization difficulty of machine
  learning benchmarks has remained challenging. We propose what is to our knowledge
  the first model-agnostic measure of the inherent generalization difficulty of tasks.
  Our inductive bias complexity measure quantifies the total information required
  to generalize well on a task minus the information provided by the data. It does
  so by measuring the fractional volume occupied by hypotheses that generalize on
  a task given that they fit the training data. It scales exponentially with the intrinsic
  dimensionality of the space over which the model must generalize but only polynomially
  in resolution per dimension, showing that tasks which require generalizing over
  many dimensions are drastically more difficult than tasks involving more detail
  in fewer dimensions. Our measure can be applied to compute and compare supervised
  learning, reinforcement learning and meta-learning generalization difficulties against
  each other. We show that applied empirically, it formally quantifies intuitively
  expected trends, e.g. that in terms of required inductive bias, MNIST $<$ CIFAR10
  $<$ Imagenet and fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs) $<$ partially
  observable MDPs. Further, we show that classification of complex images $<$ few-shot
  meta-learning with simple images. Our measure provides a quantitative metric to
  guide the construction of more complex tasks requiring greater inductive bias, and
  thereby encourages the development of more sophisticated architectures and learning
  algorithms with more powerful generalization capabilities.
