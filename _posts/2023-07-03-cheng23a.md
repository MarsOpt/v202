title: Weakly Supervised Regression with Interval Targets
openreview: O2XerBwfFk
abstract: This paper investigates an interesting weakly supervised regression setting
  called regression with interval targets (RIT). Although some of the previous methods
  on relevant regression settings can be adapted to RIT, they are not statistically
  consistent, and thus their empirical performance is not guaranteed. In this paper,
  we provide a thorough study on RIT. First, we proposed a novel statistical model
  to describe the data generation process for RIT and demonstrate its validity. Second,
  we analyze a simple selecting method for RIT, which selects a particular value in
  the interval as the target value to train the model. Third, we propose a statistically
  consistent limiting method for RIT to train the model by limiting the predictions
  to the interval. We further derive an estimation error bound for our limiting method.
  Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our proposed method.
