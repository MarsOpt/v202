title: Learning Regions of Interest for Bayesian Optimization with Adaptive Level-Set
  Estimation
openreview: 6aB43K50T0
abstract: 'We study Bayesian optimization (BO) in high-dimensional and non-stationary
  scenarios. Existing algorithms for such scenarios typically require extensive hyperparameter
  tuning, which limits their practical effectiveness. We propose a framework, called
  BALLET, which adaptively filters for a high-confidence region of interest (ROI)
  as a superlevel-set of a nonparametric probabilistic model such as a Gaussian process
  (GP). Our approach is easy to tune, and is able to focus on local region of the
  optimization space that can be tackled by existing BO methods. The key idea is to
  use two probabilistic models: a coarse GP to identify the ROI, and a localized GP
  for optimization within the ROI. We show theoretically that BALLET can efficiently
  shrink the search space, and can exhibit a tighter regret bound than standard BO
  without ROI filtering. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of BALLET on
  both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks.'
