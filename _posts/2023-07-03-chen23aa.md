title: Optimistic Online Mirror Descent for Bridging Stochastic and Adversarial Online
  Convex Optimization
openreview: xJp7rnXt1I
abstract: Stochastically Extended Adversarial (SEA) model is introduced by Sachs et
  al. (2022) as an interpolation between stochastic and adversarial online convex
  optimization. Under the smoothness condition, they demonstrate that the expected
  regret of optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) depends on the cumulative
  stochastic variance $\sigma_{1:T}^2$ and the cumulative adversarial variation $\Sigma_{1:T}^2$
  for convex functions. They also provide a slightly weaker bound based on the maximal
  stochastic variance $\sigma_{\max}^2$ and the maximal adversarial variation $\Sigma_{\max}^2$
  for strongly convex functions. Inspired by their work, we investigate the theoretical
  guarantees of optimistic online mirror descent (OMD) for the SEA model. For convex
  and smooth functions, we obtain the same $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sigma_{1:T}^2}+\sqrt{\Sigma_{1:T}^2})$
  regret bound, without the convexity requirement of individual functions. For strongly
  convex and smooth functions, we establish an $\mathcal{O}(\min\{\log (\sigma_{1:T}^2+\Sigma_{1:T}^2),
  (\sigma_{\max}^2 + \Sigma_{\max}^2) \log T\})$ bound, better than their $\mathcal{O}((\sigma_{\max}^2
  + \Sigma_{\max}^2) \log T)$ result. For exp-concave and smooth functions, we achieve
  a new $\mathcal{O}(d\log(\sigma_{1:T}^2+\Sigma_{1:T}^2))$ bound. Owing to the OMD
  framework, we further establish dynamic regret for convex and smooth functions,
  which is more favorable in non-stationary online scenarios.
