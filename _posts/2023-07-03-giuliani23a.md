title: Generalized Disparate Impact for Configurable Fairness Solutions in ML
openreview: IP5OpHHpgV
abstract: 'We make two contributions in the field of AI fairness over continuous protected
  attributes. First, we show that the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi (HGR) indicator (the
  only one currently available for such a case) is valuable but subject to a few crucial
  limitations regarding semantics, interpretability, and robustness. Second, we introduce
  a family of indicators that are: 1) complementary to HGR in terms of semantics;
  2) fully interpretable and transparent; 3) robust over finite samples; 4) configurable
  to suit specific applications. Our approach also allows us to define fine-grained
  constraints to permit certain types of dependence and forbid others selectively.
  By expanding the available options for continuous protected attributes, our approach
  represents a significant contribution to the area of fair artificial intelligence.'
