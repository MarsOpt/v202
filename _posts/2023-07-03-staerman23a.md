title: 'FaDIn: Fast Discretized Inference for Hawkes Processes with General Parametric
  Kernels'
openreview: xSzm4fFIIg
abstract: Temporal point processes (TPP) are a natural tool for modeling event-based
  data. Among all TPP models, Hawkes processes have proven to be the most widely used,
  mainly due to their adequate modeling for various applications, particularly when
  considering exponential or non-parametric kernels. Although non-parametric kernels
  are an option, such models require large datasets. While exponential kernels are
  more data efficient and relevant for specific applications where events immediately
  trigger more events, they are ill-suited for applications where latencies need to
  be estimated, such as in neuroscience. This work aims to offer an efficient solution
  to TPP inference using general parametric kernels with finite support. The developed
  solution consists of a fast $\ell_2$ gradient-based solver leveraging a discretized
  version of the events. After theoretically supporting the use of discretization,
  the statistical and computational efficiency of the novel approach is demonstrated
  through various numerical experiments. Finally, the method’s effectiveness is evaluated
  by modeling the occurrence of stimuli-induced patterns from brain signals recorded
  with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Given the use of general parametric kernels,
  results show that the proposed approach leads to an improved estimation of pattern
  latency than the state-of-the-art.
