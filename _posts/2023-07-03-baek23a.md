title: Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning
openreview: GXHL8ZS1GX
abstract: Subgraphs of a larger global graph may be distributed across multiple devices,
  and only locally accessible due to privacy restrictions, although there may be links
  between subgraphs. Recently proposed subgraph Federated Learning (FL) methods deal
  with those missing links across local subgraphs while distributively training Graph
  Neural Networks (GNNs) on them. However, they have overlooked the inevitable heterogeneity
  between subgraphs comprising different communities of a global graph, consequently
  collapsing the incompatible knowledge from local GNN models. To this end, we introduce
  a new subgraph FL problem, personalized subgraph FL, which focuses on the joint
  improvement of the interrelated local GNNs rather than learning a single global
  model, and propose a novel framework, FEDerated Personalized sUBgraph learning (FED-PUB),
  to tackle it. Since the server cannot access the subgraph in each client, FED-PUB
  utilizes functional embeddings of the local GNNs using random graphs as inputs to
  compute similarities between them, and use the similarities to perform weighted
  averaging for server-side aggregation. Further, it learns a personalized sparse
  mask at each client to select and update only the subgraph-relevant subset of the
  aggregated parameters. We validate our FED-PUB for its subgraph FL performance on
  six datasets, considering both non-overlapping and overlapping subgraphs, on which
  it significantly outperforms relevant baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/JinheonBaek/FED-PUB.
