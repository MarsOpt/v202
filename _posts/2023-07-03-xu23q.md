title: Competing for Shareable Arms in Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandits
openreview: KQaMjvlUE6
abstract: Competitions for shareable and limited resources have long been studied
  with strategic agents. In reality, agents often have to learn and maximize the rewards
  of the resources at the same time. To design an individualized competing policy,
  we model the competition between agents in a novel multi-player multi-armed bandit
  (MPMAB) setting where players are selfish and aim to maximize their own rewards.
  In addition, when several players pull the same arm, we assume that these players
  averagely share the arms’ rewards by expectation. Under this setting, we first analyze
  the Nash equilibrium when arms’ rewards are known. Subsequently, we propose a novel
  Selfish MPMAB with Averaging Allocation (SMAA) approach based on the equilibrium.
  We theoretically demonstrate that SMAA could achieve a good regret guarantee for
  each player when all players follow the algorithm. Additionally, we establish that
  no single selfish player can significantly increase their rewards through deviation,
  nor can they detrimentally affect other players’ rewards without incurring substantial
  losses for themselves. We finally validate the effectiveness of the method in extensive
  synthetic experiments.
