title: Coordinated Dynamic Bidding in Repeated Second-Price Auctions with Budgets
openreview: P78iqH28ni
abstract: In online ad markets, a rising number of advertisers are employing bidding
  agencies to participate in ad auctions. These agencies are specialized in designing
  online algorithms and bidding on behalf of their clients. Typically, an agency usually
  has information on multiple advertisers, so she can potentially coordinate bids
  to help her clients achieve higher utilities than those under independent bidding.
  In this paper, we study coordinated online bidding algorithms in repeated second-price
  auctions with budgets. We propose algorithms that guarantee every client a higher
  utility than the best she can get under independent bidding. We show that these
  algorithms achieve maximal social welfare and discuss biddersâ€™ incentives to misreport
  their budgets, in symmetric cases. Our proofs combine the techniques of online learning
  and equilibrium analysis, overcoming the difficulty of competing with a multi-dimensional
  benchmark. The performance of our algorithms is further evaluated by experiments
  on both synthetic and real data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
  to consider bidder coordination in online repeated auctions with constraints.
