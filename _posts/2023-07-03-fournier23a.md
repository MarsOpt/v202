title: Can Forward Gradient Match Backpropagation?
openreview: qcU9ngAPGC
abstract: Forward Gradients - the idea of using directional derivatives in forward
  differentiation mode - have recently been shown to be utilizable for neural network
  training while avoiding problems generally associated with backpropagation gradient
  computation, such as locking and memorization requirements. The cost is the requirement
  to guess the step direction, which is hard in high dimensions. While current solutions
  rely on weighted averages over isotropic guess vector distributions, we propose
  to strongly bias our gradient guesses in directions that are much more promising,
  such as feedback obtained from small, local auxiliary networks. For a standard computer
  vision neural network, we conduct a rigorous study systematically covering a variety
  of combinations of gradient targets and gradient guesses, including those previously
  presented in the literature. We find that using gradients obtained from a local
  loss as a candidate direction drastically improves on random noise in Forward Gradient
  methods.
