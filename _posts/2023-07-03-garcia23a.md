title: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Few-shot Learning for Machine Translation
openreview: zvCSNsoyKW
abstract: We demonstrate the potential of few-shot translation systems, trained with
  unpaired language data, for both high and low-resource language pairs. We show that
  with only 5 examples of high-quality translation data shown at inference, a transformer
  decoder-only model trained solely with self-supervised learning, is able to match
  specialized supervised state-of-the-art models as well as more general commercial
  translation systems. In particular, we outperform the best performing system on
  the WMT’21 English-Chinese news translation task by only using five examples of
  English-Chinese parallel data at inference. Furthermore, the resulting models are
  two orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art language models. We then analyze
  the factors which impact the performance of few-shot translation systems, and highlight
  that the quality of the few-shot demonstrations heavily determines the quality of
  the translations generated by our models. Finally, we show that the few-shot paradigm
  also provides a way to control certain attributes of the translation — we show that
  we are able to control for regional varieties and formality using only a five examples
  at inference, paving the way towards controllable machine translation systems.
