title: Disentangled Multiplex Graph Representation Learning
openreview: lYZOjMvxws
abstract: Unsupervised multiplex graph representation learning (UMGRL) has received
  increasing interest, but few works simultaneously focused on the common and private
  information extraction. In this paper, we argue that it is essential for conducting
  effective and robust UMGRL to extract complete and clean common information, as
  well as more-complementarity and less-noise private information. To achieve this,
  we first investigate disentangled representation learning for the multiplex graph
  to capture complete and clean common information, as well as design a contrastive
  constraint to preserve the complementarity and remove the noise in the private information.
  Moreover, we theoretically analyze that the common and private representations learned
  by our method are provably disentangled and contain more task-relevant and less
  task-irrelevant information to benefit downstream tasks. Extensive experiments verify
  the superiority of the proposed method in terms of different downstream tasks.
