title: One-Step Estimator for Permuted Sparse Recovery
openreview: 7JuHd1ZZN4
abstract: This paper considers the unlabeled sparse recovery under multiple measurements,
  i.e., ${\mathbf{Y}} = {\mathbf{\Pi}}^{\natural} {\mathbf{X}} {\mathbf{B}}^{\natural}
  + {\mathbf{W}}$, where ${\mathbf{Y}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, {\mathbf{\Pi}}^{\natural}\in
  \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}, {\mathbf{X}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}, {\mathbf{B}} ^{\natural}\in
  \mathbb{R}^{p\times m}, {\mathbf{W}}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ represents the observations,
  missing (or incomplete) correspondence information, sensing matrix, sparse signals,
  and additive sensing noise, respectively. Different from the previous works on multiple
  measurements ($m > 1$) which all focus on the sufficient samples regime, namely,
  $n > p$, we consider a sparse matrix $\mathbf{B}^{\natural}$ and investigate the
  insufficient samples regime (i.e., $n \ll p$) for the first time. To begin with,
  we establish the lower bound on the sample number and <em>signal-to-noise ratio</em>
  ($ {\mathsf{SNR}}$) for the correct permutation recovery. Moreover, we present a
  simple yet effective estimator. Under mild conditions, we show that our estimator
  can restore the correct correspondence information with high probability. Numerical
  experiments are presented to corroborate our theoretical claims.
