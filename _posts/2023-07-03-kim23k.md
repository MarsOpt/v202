title: 'LESSON: Learning to Integrate Exploration Strategies for Reinforcement Learning
  via an Option Framework'
openreview: vXcvrYJlVm
abstract: In this paper, a unified framework for exploration in reinforcement learning
  (RL) is proposed based on an option-critic architecture. The proposed framework
  learns to integrate a set of diverse exploration strategies so that the agent can
  adaptively select the most effective exploration strategy to realize an effective
  exploration-exploitation trade-off for each given task. The effectiveness of the
  proposed exploration framework is demonstrated by various experiments in the MiniGrid
  and Atari environments.
