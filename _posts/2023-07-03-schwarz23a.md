title: Modality-Agnostic Variational Compression of Implicit Neural Representations
openreview: bBXCCSoVQZ
abstract: We introduce a modality-agnostic neural compression algorithm based on a
  functional view of data and parameterised as an Implicit Neural Representation (INR).
  Bridging the gap between latent coding and sparsity, we obtain compact latent representations
  non-linearly mapped to a soft gating mechanism. This allows the specialisation of
  a shared INR network to each data item through subnetwork selection. After obtaining
  a dataset of such latent representations, we directly optimise the rate/distortion
  trade-off in a modality-agnostic space using neural compression. Variational Compression
  of Implicit Neural Representations (VC-INR) shows improved performance given the
  same representational capacity pre quantisation while also outperforming previous
  quantisation schemes used for other INR techniques.Our experiments demonstrate strong
  results over a large set of diverse modalities using the same algorithm without
  any modality-specific inductive biases. We show results on images, climate data,
  3D shapes and scenes as well as audio and video, introducing VC-INR as the first
  INR-based method to outperform codecs as well-known and diverse as JPEG 2000, MP3
  and AVC/HEVC on their respective modalities.
