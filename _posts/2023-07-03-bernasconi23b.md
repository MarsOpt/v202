title: Constrained Phi-Equilibria
openreview: RgwqlatND7
abstract: The computational study of equilibria involving constraints on players’
  strategies has been largely neglected. However, in real-world applications, players
  are usually subject to constraints ruling out the feasibility of some of their strategies,
  such as, e.g., safety requirements and budget caps. Computational studies on constrained
  versions of the Nash equilibrium have lead to some results under very stringent
  assumptions, while finding constrained versions of the correlated equilibrium (CE)
  is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce and computationally characterize
  constrained Phi-equilibria—a more general notion than constrained CEs—in normal-form
  games. We show that computing such equilibria is in general computationally intractable,
  and also that the set of the equilibria may not be convex, providing a sharp divide
  with unconstrained CEs. Nevertheless, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for
  computing a constrained (approximate) Phi-equilibrium maximizing a given linear
  function, when either the number of constraints or that of players’ actions is fixed.
  Moreover, in the special case in which a player’s constraints do not depend on other
  players’ strategies, we show that an exact, function-maximizing equilibrium can
  be computed in polynomial time, while one (approximate) equilibrium can be found
  with an efficient decentralized no-regret learning algorithm.
