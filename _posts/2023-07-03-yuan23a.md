title: Coordinate Descent Methods for Fractional Minimization
openreview: odCqtXjSgB
abstract: We consider a class of structured fractional minimization problems, in which
  the numerator part of the objective is the sum of a differentiable convex function
  and a convex non-smooth function, while the denominator part is a convex or concave
  function. This problem is difficult to solve since it is non-convex. By exploiting
  the structure of the problem, we propose two Coordinate Descent (CD) methods for
  solving this problem. The proposed methods iteratively solve a one-dimensional subproblem
  <em>globally</em>, and they are guaranteed to converge to coordinate-wise stationary
  points. In the case of a convex denominator, under a weak <em>locally bounded non-convexity
  condition</em>, we prove that the optimality of coordinate-wise stationary point
  is stronger than that of the standard critical point and directional point. Under
  additional suitable conditions, CD methods converge Q-linearly to coordinate-wise
  stationary points. In the case of a concave denominator, we show that any critical
  point is a global minimum, and CD methods converge to the global minimum with a
  sublinear convergence rate. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods
  to some machine learning and signal processing models. Our experiments on real-world
  data have shown that our method significantly and consistently outperforms existing
  methods in terms of accuracy.
