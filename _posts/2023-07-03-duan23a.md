title: Fast Excess Risk Rates via Offset Rademacher Complexity
openreview: RGiPlFCQeK
abstract: Based on the offset Rademacher complexity, this work outlines a systematical
  framework for deriving sharp excess risk bounds in statistical learning without
  Bernstein condition. In addition to recovering fast rates in a unified way for some
  parametric and nonparametric supervised learning models with minimum identifiability
  assumptions, we also obtain new and improved results for LAD (sparse) linear regression
  and deep logistic regression with deep ReLU neural networks, respectively.
