title: A Closer Look at the Intervention Procedure of Concept Bottleneck Models
openreview: YIWtM3GdZc
abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are a class of interpretable neural network
  models that predict the target response of a given input based on its high-level
  concepts. Unlike the standard end-to-end models, CBMs enable domain experts to intervene
  on the predicted concepts and rectify any mistakes at test time, so that more accurate
  task predictions can be made at the end. While such intervenability provides a powerful
  avenue of control, many aspects of the intervention procedure remain rather unexplored.
  In this work, we develop various ways of selecting intervening concepts to improve
  the intervention effectiveness and conduct an array of in-depth analyses as to how
  they evolve under different circumstances. Specifically, we find that an informed
  intervention strategy can reduce the task error more than ten times compared to
  the current baseline under the same amount of intervention counts in realistic settings,
  and yet, this can vary quite significantly when taking into account different intervention
  granularity. We verify our findings through comprehensive evaluations, not only
  on the standard real datasets, but also on synthetic datasets that we generate based
  on a set of different causal graphs. We further discover some major pitfalls of
  the current practices which, without a proper addressing, raise concerns on reliability
  and fairness of the intervention procedure.
