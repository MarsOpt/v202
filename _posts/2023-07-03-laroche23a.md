title: On the Occupancy Measure of Non-Markovian Policies in Continuous MDPs
openreview: Vv8vyf3RtU
abstract: The state-action occupancy measure of a policy is the expected (discounted
  or undiscounted) number of times a state-action couple is visited in a trajectory.
  For decades, RL books have been reporting the occupancy equivalence between Markovian
  and non-Markovian policies in countable state-action spaces under mild conditions.
  This equivalence states that the occupancy of any non-Markovian policy can be equivalently
  obtained by a Markovian policy, i.e. a memoryless probability distribution, conditioned
  only on its current state. While expected, for technical reasons, the translation
  of this result to continuous state space has resisted until now. Our main contribution
  is to fill this gap and to provide a general measure-theoretic treatment of the
  problem, permitting, in particular, its extension to continuous MDPs. Furthermore,
  we show that when the occupancy is infinite, we may encounter some non-trivial cases
  where the result does not hold anymore.
