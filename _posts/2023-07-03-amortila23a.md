title: The Optimal Approximation Factors in Misspecified Off-Policy Value Function
  Estimation
openreview: OT6gRRMmcE
abstract: Theoretical guarantees in reinforcement learning (RL) are known to suffer
  multiplicative blow-up factors with respect to the misspecification error of function
  approximation. Yet, the nature of such <em>approximation factors</em>—especially
  their optimal form in a given learning problem—is poorly understood. In this paper
  we study this question in linear off-policy value function estimation, where many
  open questions remain. We study the approximation factor in a broad spectrum of
  settings, such as presence vs. absence of state aliasing and full vs. partial coverage
  of the state space. Our core results include instance-dependent upper bounds on
  the approximation factors with respect to both the weighted $L_2$-norm (where the
  weighting is the offline state distribution) and the $L_\infty$ norm. We show that
  these approximation factors are optimal (in an instance-dependent sense) for a number
  of these settings. In other cases, we show that the instance-dependent parameters
  which appear in the upper bounds are necessary, and that the finiteness of either
  alone cannot guarantee a finite approximation factor even in the limit of infinite
  data.
