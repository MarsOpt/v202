title: A Statistical Perspective on Retrieval-Based Models
openreview: 0bR5JuxaoN
abstract: 'Many modern high-performing machine learning models increasingly rely on
  scaling up models, e.g., transformer networks. Simultaneously, a parallel line of
  work aims to improve the model performance by augmenting an input instance with
  other (labeled) instances during inference. Examples of such augmentations include
  task-specific prompts and similar examples retrieved from the training data by a
  nonparametric component. Despite a growing literature showcasing the promise of
  these retrieval-based models, their theoretical underpinnings %for such models remain
  under-explored. In this paper, we present a formal treatment of retrieval-based
  models to characterize their performance via a novel statistical perspective. In
  particular, we study two broad classes of retrieval-based classification approaches:
  First, we analyze a local learning framework that employs an explicit local empirical
  risk minimization based on retrieved examples for each input instance. Interestingly,
  we show that breaking down the underlying learning task into local sub-tasks enables
  the model to employ a low complexity parametric component to ensure good overall
  performance. The second class of retrieval-based approaches we explore learns a
  global model using kernel methods to directly map an input instance and retrieved
  examples to a prediction, without explicitly solving a local learning task.'
