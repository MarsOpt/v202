title: Stratified Adversarial Robustness with Rejection
openreview: LZt1HIEoAf
abstract: Recently, there is an emerging interest in adversarially training a classifier
  with a rejection option (also known as a selective classifier) for boosting adversarial
  robustness. While rejection can incur a cost in many applications, existing studies
  typically associate zero cost with rejecting perturbed inputs, which can result
  in the rejection of numerous slightly-perturbed inputs that could be correctly classified.
  In this work, we study adversarially-robust classification with rejection in the
  stratified rejection setting, where the rejection cost is modeled by rejection loss
  functions monotonically non-increasing in the perturbation magnitude. We theoretically
  analyze the stratified rejection setting and propose a novel defense method – Adversarial
  Training with Consistent Prediction-based Rejection (CPR) – for building a robust
  selective classifier. Experiments on image datasets demonstrate that the proposed
  method significantly outperforms existing methods under strong adaptive attacks.
  For instance, on CIFAR-10, CPR reduces the total robust loss (for different rejection
  losses) by at least 7.3% under both seen and unseen attacks.
