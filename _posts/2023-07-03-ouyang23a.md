title: Improving Adversarial Robustness Through the Contrastive-Guided Diffusion Process
openreview: 9iNScYEBWZ
abstract: Synthetic data generation has become an emerging tool to help improve the
  adversarial robustness in classification tasks, since robust learning requires a
  significantly larger amount of training samples compared with standard classification.
  Among various deep generative models, the diffusion model has been shown to produce
  high-quality synthetic images and has achieved good performance in improving the
  adversarial robustness. However, diffusion-type methods are generally slower in
  data generation as compared with other generative models. Although different acceleration
  techniques have been proposed recently, it is also of great importance to study
  how to improve the sample efficiency of synthetic data for the downstream task.
  In this paper, we first analyze the optimality condition of synthetic distribution
  for achieving improved robust accuracy. We show that enhancing the distinguishability
  among the generated data is critical for improving adversarial robustness. Thus,
  we propose the Contrastive-Guided Diffusion Process (Contrastive-DP), which incorporates
  the contrastive loss to guide the diffusion model in data generation. We validate
  our theoretical results using simulations and demonstrate the good performance of
  Contrastive-DP on image datasets.
