title: 'IncDSI: Incrementally Updatable Document Retrieval'
openreview: OYFeXaUzzr
abstract: 'Differentiable Search Index is a recently proposed paradigm for document
  retrieval, that encodes information about a corpus of documents within the parameters
  of a neural network and directly maps queries to corresponding documents. These
  models have achieved state-of-the-art performances for document retrieval across
  many benchmarks. These kinds of models have a significant limitation: it is not
  easy to add new documents after a model is trained. We propose IncDSI, a method
  to add documents in real time (about 20-50ms per document), without retraining the
  model on the entire dataset (or even parts thereof). Instead we formulate the addition
  of documents as a constrained optimization problem that makes minimal changes to
  the network parameters. Although orders of magnitude faster, our approach is competitive
  with re-training the model on the whole dataset and enables the development of document
  retrieval systems that can be updated with new information in real-time. Our code
  for IncDSI is available at https://github.com/varshakishore/IncDSI.'
