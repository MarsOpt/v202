title: 'Understanding Incremental Learning of Gradient Descent: A Fine-grained Analysis
  of Matrix Sensing'
openreview: KyrBgfbQls
abstract: 'It is believed that Gradient Descent (GD) induces an implicit bias towards
  good generalization in training machine learning models. This paper provides a fine-grained
  analysis of the dynamics of GD for the matrix sensing problem, whose goal is to
  recover a low-rank ground-truth matrix from near-isotropic linear measurements.
  It is shown that GD with small initialization behaves similarly to the greedy low-rank
  learning heuristics and follows an incremental learning procedure: GD sequentially
  learns solutions with increasing ranks until it recovers the ground truth matrix.
  Compared to existing works which only analyze the first learning phase for rank-1
  solutions, our result provides characterizations for the whole learning process.
  Moreover, besides the over-parameterized regime that many prior works focused on,
  our analysis of the incremental learning procedure also applies to the <em>under-parameterized</em>
  regime. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to confirm our theoretical findings.'
