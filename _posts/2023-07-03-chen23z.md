title: Layered State Discovery for Incremental Autonomous Exploration
openreview: ivXO8yB9JE
abstract: We study the autonomous exploration (AX) problem proposed by Lim & Auer
  (2012). In this setting, the objective is to discover a set of $\epsilon$-optimal
  policies reaching a set $\mathcal{S}_L^{\rightarrow}$ of incrementally $L$-controllable
  states. We introduce a novel layered decomposition of the set of incrementally $L$-controllable
  states that is based on the iterative application of a state-expansion operator.
  We leverage these results to design Layered Autonomous Exploration (LAE), a novel
  algorithm for AX that attains a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(LS^{\rightarrow}_{L(1+\epsilon)}\Gamma_{L(1+\epsilon)}
  A \ln^{12}(S^{\rightarrow}_{L(1+\epsilon)})/\epsilon^2)$, where $S^{\rightarrow}_{L(1+\epsilon)}$
  is the number of states that are incrementally $L(1+\epsilon)$-controllable, $A$
  is the number of actions, and $\Gamma_{L(1+\epsilon)}$ is the branching factor of
  the transitions over such states. LAE improves over the algorithm of Tarbouriech
  et al. (2020a) by a factor of $L^2$ and it is the first algorithm for AX that works
  in a countably-infinite state space. Moreover, we show that, under a certain identifiability
  assumption, LAE achieves minimax-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(LS^{\rightarrow}_{L}A\ln^{12}(S^{\rightarrow}_{L})/\epsilon^2)$,
  outperforming existing algorithms and matching for the first time the lower bound
  proved by Cai et al. (2022) up to logarithmic factors.
