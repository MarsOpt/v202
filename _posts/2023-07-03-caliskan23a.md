title: Multi-Agent Learning from Learners
openreview: LVluQl5lAk
abstract: A large body of the "Inverse Reinforcement Learning" (IRL) literature focuses
  on recovering the reward function from a set of demonstrations of an expert agent
  who acts optimally or noisily optimally. Nevertheless, some recent works move away
  from the optimality assumption to study the "Learning from a Learner (LfL)" problem,
  where the challenge is inferring the reward function of a learning agent from a
  sequence of demonstrations produced by progressively improving policies. In this
  work, we take one of the initial steps in addressing the multi-agent version of
  this problem and propose a new algorithm, MA-LfL (Multiagent Learning from a Learner).
  Unlike the state-of-the-art literature, which recovers the reward functions from
  trajectories produced by agents in some equilibrium, we study the problem of inferring
  the reward functions of interacting agents in a general sum stochastic game without
  assuming any equilibrium state. The MA-LfL algorithm is rigorously built on a theoretical
  result that ensures its validity in the case of agents learning according to a multi-agent
  soft policy iteration scheme. We empirically test MA-LfL and we observe high positive
  correlation between the recovered reward functions and the ground truth.
