title: An Investigation into Pre-Training Object-Centric Representations for Reinforcement
  Learning
openreview: ICWVUy4fhR
abstract: Unsupervised object-centric representation (OCR) learning has recently drawn
  attention as a new paradigm of visual representation. This is because of its <em>potential</em>
  of being an effective pre-training technique for various downstream tasks in terms
  of sample efficiency, systematic generalization, and reasoning. Although image-based
  reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most important and thus frequently mentioned
  such downstream tasks, the benefit in RL has surprisingly not been investigated
  systematically thus far. Instead, most of the evaluations have focused on rather
  indirect metrics such as segmentation quality and object property prediction accuracy.
  In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of OCR pre-training for image-based
  reinforcement learning via empirical experiments. For systematic evaluation, we
  introduce a simple object-centric visual RL benchmark and conduct experiments to
  answer questions such as "Does OCR pre-training improve performance on object-centric
  tasks?" and "Can OCR pre-training help with out-of-distribution generalization?".
  Our results provide empirical evidence for valuable insights into the effectiveness
  of OCR pre-training for RL and the potential limitations of its use in certain scenarios.
  Additionally, this study also examines the critical aspects of incorporating OCR
  pre-training in RL, including performance in a visually complex environment and
  the appropriate pooling layer to aggregate the object representations.
