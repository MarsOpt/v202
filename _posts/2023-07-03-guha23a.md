title: On Excess Mass Behavior in Gaussian Mixture Models with Orlicz-Wasserstein
  Distances
openreview: X9enIC31dY
abstract: Dirichlet Process mixture models (DPMM) in combination with Gaussian kernels
  have been an important modeling tool for numerous data domains arising from biological,
  physical, and social sciences. However, this versatility in applications does not
  extend to strong theoretical guarantees for the underlying parameter estimates,
  for which only a logarithmic rate is achieved. In this work, we (re)introduce and
  investigate a metric, named Orlicz-Wasserstein distance, in the study of the Bayesian
  contraction behavior for the parameters. We show that despite the overall slow convergence
  guarantees for all the parameters, posterior contraction for parameters happens
  at almost polynomial rates in outlier regions of the parameter space. Our theoretical
  results provide new insight in understanding the convergence behavior of parameters
  arising from various settings of hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric models. In
  addition, we provide an algorithm to compute the metric by leveraging Sinkhorn divergences
  and validate our findings through a simulation study.
