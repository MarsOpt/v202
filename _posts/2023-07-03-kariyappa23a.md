title: 'Cocktail Party Attack: Breaking Aggregation-Based Privacy in Federated Learning
  Using Independent Component Analysis'
openreview: Ai1TyAjZt9
abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to perform privacy-preserving machine learning
  on distributed data held by multiple data owners. To this end, FL requires the data
  owners to perform training locally and share the gradients or weight updates (instead
  of the private inputs) with the central server, which are then securely aggregated
  over multiple data owners. Although aggregation by itself does not offer provable
  privacy protection, prior work suggested that if the batch size is sufficiently
  large the aggregation may be secure enough. In this paper, we propose the Cocktail
  Party Attack (CPA) that, contrary to prior belief, is able to recover the private
  inputs from gradients/weight updates aggregated over as many as 1024 samples. CPA
  leverages the crucial insight that aggregate gradients from a fully connected (FC)
  layer is a linear combination of its inputs, which allows us to frame gradient inversion
  as a blind source separation (BSS) problem. We adapt independent component analysis
  (ICA)—a classic solution to the BSS problem—to recover private inputs for FC and
  convolutional networks, and show that CPA significantly outperforms prior gradient
  inversion attacks, scales to ImageNet-sized inputs, and works on large batch sizes
  of up to 1024.
