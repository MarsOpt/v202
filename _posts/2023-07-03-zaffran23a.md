title: Conformal Prediction with Missing Values
openreview: BUv0BLrosh
abstract: 'Conformal prediction is a theoretically grounded framework for constructing
  predictive intervals. We study conformal prediction with missing values in the covariates
  â€“ a setting that brings new challenges to uncertainty quantification. We first show
  that the marginal coverage guarantee of conformal prediction holds on imputed data
  for any missingness distribution and almost all imputation functions. However, we
  emphasize that the average coverage varies depending on the pattern of missing values:
  conformal methods tend to construct prediction intervals that under-cover the response
  conditionally to some missing patterns. This motivates our novel generalized conformalized
  quantile regression framework, missing data augmentation, which yields prediction
  intervals that are valid conditionally to the patterns of missing values, despite
  their exponential number. We then show that a universally consistent quantile regression
  algorithm trained on the imputed data is Bayes optimal for the pinball risk, thus
  achieving valid coverage conditionally to any given data point. Moreover, we examine
  the case of a linear model, which demonstrates the importance of our proposal in
  overcoming the heteroskedasticity induced by missing values. Using synthetic and
  data from critical care, we corroborate our theory and report improved performance
  of our methods.'
