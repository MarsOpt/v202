title: 'Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: Mutual Information Bounds and
  Learning Algorithms'
openreview: DDwSa7XDxA
abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) from observational studies
  is rising in importance due to the widespread accumulation of data in many fields.
  Due to the selection bias behind the inaccessibility of counterfactual data, the
  problem differs fundamentally from supervised learning in a challenging way. However,
  existing works on modeling selection bias and corresponding algorithms do not naturally
  generalize to non-binary treatment spaces. To address this limitation, we propose
  to use mutual information to describe selection bias in estimating HTE and derive
  a novel error bound using the mutual information between the covariates and the
  treatments, which is the first error bound to cover general treatment schemes including
  multinoulli or continuous spaces. We then bring forth theoretically justified algorithms,
  the Mutual Information Treatment Network (MitNet), using adversarial optimization
  to reduce selection bias and obtain more accurate HTE estimations. Our algorithm
  reaches remarkable performance in both simulation study and empirical evaluation.
