title: 'JAWS-X: Addressing Efficiency Bottlenecks of Conformal Prediction Under Standard
  and Feedback Covariate Shift'
openreview: ORxBEWMPAJ
abstract: 'We study the efficient estimation of predictive confidence intervals for
  black-box predictors when the common data exchangeability (e.g., i.i.d.) assumption
  is violated due to potentially feedback-induced shifts in the input data distribution.
  That is, we focus on standard and feedback covariate shift (FCS), where the latter
  allows for feedback dependencies between train and test data that occur in many
  decision-making scenarios like experimental design. Whereas prior conformal prediction
  methods for this problem are in general either extremely computationally demanding
  or make inefficient use of labeled data, we propose a collection of methods based
  on the jackknife+ that achieve a practical balance of computational and statistical
  efficiency. Theoretically, our proposed JAW-FCS method extends the rigorous, finite-sample
  coverage guarantee of the jackknife+ to FCS. We moreover propose two tunable relaxations
  to JAW-FCSâ€™s computation that maintain finite-sample guarantees: one using only
  $K$ leave-one-out models (JAW-$K$LOO) and a second building on $K$-fold cross validation+
  (WCV+). Practically, we demonstrate that JAW-FCS and its computational relaxations
  outperform state-of-the-art baselines on a variety of real-world datasets under
  standard and feedback covariate shift, including for biomolecular design and active
  learning tasks.'
