title: Fairness in Matching under Uncertainty
openreview: oDR4MurRrT
abstract: The prevalence and importance of algorithmic two-sided marketplaces has
  drawn attention to the issue of fairness in such settings. Algorithmic decisions
  are used in assigning students to schools, users to advertisers, and applicants
  to job interviews. These decisions should heed the preferences of individuals, and
  simultaneously be fair with respect to their merits (synonymous with fit, future
  performance, or need). Merits conditioned on observable features are always <em>uncertain</em>,
  a fact that is exacerbated by the widespread use of machine learning algorithms
  to infer merit from the observables. As our key contribution, we carefully axiomatize
  a notion of individual fairness in the two-sided marketplace setting which respects
  the uncertainty in the merits; indeed, it simultaneously recognizes uncertainty
  as the primary potential cause of unfairness and an approach to address it. We design
  a linear programming framework to find fair utility-maximizing distributions over
  allocations, and we show that the linear program is robust to perturbations in the
  estimated parameters of the uncertain merit distributions, a key property in combining
  the approach with machine learning techniques.
