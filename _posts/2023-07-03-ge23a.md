title: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Mediation Analysis
openreview: hd8wCvtgIN
abstract: Mediation analysis learns the causal effect transmitted via mediator variables
  between treatments and outcomes, and receives increasing attention in various scientific
  domains to elucidate causal relations. Most existing works focus on point-exposure
  studies where each subject only receives one treatment at a single time point. However,
  there are a number of applications (e.g., mobile health) where the treatments are
  sequentially assigned over time and the dynamic mediation effects are of primary
  interest. Proposing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we are the first to
  evaluate dynamic mediation effects in settings with infinite horizons. We decompose
  the average treatment effect into an immediate direct effect, an immediate mediation
  effect, a delayed direct effect, and a delayed mediation effect. Upon the identification
  of each effect component, we further develop robust and semi-parametrically efficient
  estimators under the RL framework to infer these causal effects. The superior performance
  of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies, theoretical
  results, and an analysis of a mobile health dataset. A Python implementation of
  the proposed procedure is available at https://github.com/linlinlin97/MediationRL.
