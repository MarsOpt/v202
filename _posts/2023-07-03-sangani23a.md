title: Discrete Continuous Optimization Framework for Simultaneous Clustering and
  Training in Mixture Models
openreview: 3MlWDiBcpr
abstract: We study a new framework of learning mixture models via automatic clustering
  called PRESTO, wherein we optimize a joint objective function on the model parameters
  and the partitioning, with each model tailored to perform well on its specific cluster.
  In contrast to prior work, we do not assume any generative model for the data. We
  convert our training problem to a joint parameter estimation cum a subset selection
  problem, subject to a matroid span constraint. This allows us to reduce our problem
  into a constrained set function minimization problem, where the underlying objective
  is monotone and approximately submodular. We then propose a new joint discrete-continuous
  optimization algorithm that achieves a bounded approximation guarantee for our problem.
  We show that PRESTO outperforms several alternative methods. Finally, we study PRESTO
  in the context of resource-efficient deep learning, where we train smaller resource-constrained
  models on each partition and show that it outperforms existing data partitioning
  and model pruning/knowledge distillation approaches, which in contrast to PRESTO,
  require large initial (teacher) models.
