title: A Connection between One-Step RL and Critic Regularization in Reinforcement
  Learning
openreview: XXC601YWgq
abstract: 'As with any machine learning problem with limited data, effective offline
  RL algorithms require careful regularization to avoid overfitting. One class of
  methods, known as one-step RL, perform just one step of policy improvement. These
  methods, which include advantage-weighted regression and conditional behavioral
  cloning, are thus simple and stable, but can have limited asymptotic performance.
  A second class of methods, known as critic regularization, perform many steps of
  policy improvement with a regularized objective. These methods typically require
  more compute but have appealing lower-bound guarantees. In this paper, we draw a
  connection between these methods: applying a multi-step critic regularization method
  with a regularization coefficient of 1 yields the same policy as one-step RL. While
  our theoretical results require assumptions (e.g., deterministic dynamics), our
  experiments nevertheless show that our analysis makes accurate, testable predictions
  about practical offline RL methods (CQL and one-step RL) with commonly-used hyperparameters.'
