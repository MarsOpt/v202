title: 'The Ideal Continual Learner: An Agent That Never Forgets'
openreview: o7BOzuqFi2
abstract: The goal of continual learning is to find a model that solves multiple learning
  tasks which are presented sequentially to the learner. A key challenge in this setting
  is that the learner may "forget" how to solve a previous task when learning a new
  task, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge,
  many practical methods have been proposed, including memory-based, regularization-based
  and expansion-based methods. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of these
  methods remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this gap between theory and practice
  by proposing a new continual learning framework called "Ideal Continual Learner"
  (ICL), which is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic forgetting by construction. We
  show that ICL unifies multiple well-established continual learning methods and gives
  new theoretical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. We
  also derive generalization bounds for ICL which allow us to theoretically quantify
  "how rehearsal affects generalization". Finally, we connect ICL to several classic
  subjects and research topics of modern interest, which allows us to make historical
  remarks and inspire future directions.
