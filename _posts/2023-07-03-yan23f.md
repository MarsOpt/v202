title: Fast Rates in Time-Varying Strongly Monotone Games
openreview: v8jOzpludB
abstract: Multi-player online games depict the interaction of multiple players with
  each other over time. Strongly monotone games are of particular interest since they
  have benign properties and also relate to many classic games that have applications
  in real life. Existing works mainly focus on the time-invariant case with provable
  guarantees established. However, the research of the more general <em>time-varying</em>
  games in changing environments is underexplored and the best-known result cannot
  match the guarantees in the time-invariant case. In this work, we present a new
  decentralized online algorithm for time-varying strongly monotone games, which greatly
  improves existing results and obtains fast rates, matching the best time-invariant
  guarantee without knowing the environmental non-stationarity. Furthermore, to achieve
  faster rates, we generalize the RVU property with smoothness and establish a series
  of problem-dependent bounds that also match the best time-invariant one. To realize
  all those results, we make a comprehensive use of the techniques in non-stationary
  and universal online learning.
