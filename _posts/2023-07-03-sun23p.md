title: Feature Expansion for Graph Neural Networks
openreview: YzmK8afGvq
abstract: Graph neural networks aim to learn representations for graph-structured
  data and show impressive performance in node classification. Recently, many methods
  have studied the representations of GNNs from the perspective of optimization goals
  and spectral graph theory. However, the feature space that dominates representation
  learning has not been systematically studied in graph neural networks. In this paper,
  we propose to fill this gap by analyzing the feature space of both spatial and spectral
  models. We decompose graph neural networks into determined feature spaces and trainable
  weights, providing the convenience of studying the feature space explicitly using
  matrix space analysis. In particular, we find theoretically that the feature space
  tends to be linearly correlated due to repeated aggregations. In this case, the
  feature space is bounded by the poor representation of shared weights or the limited
  dimensionality of node attributes in existing models, leading to poor performance.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose 1) feature subspaces flattening and 2) structural
  principal components to expand the feature space. Extensive experiments verify the
  effectiveness of our proposed more comprehensive feature space, with comparable
  inference time to the baseline, and demonstrate its efficient convergence capability.
