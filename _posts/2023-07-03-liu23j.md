title: 'Cones: Concept Neurons in Diffusion Models for Customized Generation'
openreview: 31H0gfU8Ar
abstract: Human brains respond to semantic features of presented stimuli with different
  neurons. This raises the question of whether deep neural networks admit a similar
  behavior pattern. To investigate this phenomenon, this paper identifies a small
  cluster of neurons associated with a specific subject in a diffusion model. We call
  those neurons the concept neurons. They can be identified by statistics of network
  gradients to a stimulation connected with the given subject. The concept neurons
  demonstrate magnetic properties in interpreting and manipulating generation results.
  Shutting them can directly yield the related subject contextualized in different
  scenes. Concatenating multiple clusters of concept neurons can vividly generate
  all related concepts in a single image. Our method attains impressive performance
  for multi-subject customization, even four or more subjects. For large-scale applications,
  the concept neurons are environmentally friendly as we only need to store a sparse
  cluster of int index instead of dense float32 parameter values, reducing storage
  consumption by 90% compared with previous customized generation methods. Extensive
  qualitative and quantitative studies on diverse scenarios show the superiority of
  our method in interpreting and manipulating diffusion models.
