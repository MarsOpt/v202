title: Hyperbolic Image-text Representations
openreview: mDHWy6zwzD
abstract: Visual and linguistic concepts naturally organize themselves in a hierarchy,
  where a textual concept "dog" entails all images that contain dogs. Despite being
  intuitive, current large-scale vision and language models such as CLIP do not explicitly
  capture such hierarchy. We propose MERU, a contrastive model that yields hyperbolic
  representations of images and text. Hyperbolic spaces have suitable geometric properties
  to embed tree-like data, so MERU can better capture the underlying hierarchy in
  image-text datasets. Our results show that MERU learns a highly interpretable and
  structured representation space while being competitive with CLIPâ€™s performance
  on standard multi-modal tasks like image classification and image-text retrieval.
