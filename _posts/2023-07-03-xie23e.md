title: A Critical View of Vision-Based Long-Term Dynamics Prediction Under Environment
  Misalignment
openreview: 5XtZGZ9o4Q
abstract: 'Dynamics prediction, which is the problem of predicting future states of
  scene objects based on current and prior states, is drawing increasing attention
  as an instance of learning physics. To solve this problem, Region Proposal Convolutional
  Interaction Network (RPCIN), a vision-based model, was proposed and achieved state-of-the-art
  performance in long-term prediction. RPCIN only takes raw images and simple object
  descriptions, such as the bounding box and segmentation mask of each object, as
  input. However, despite its success, the modelâ€™s capability can be compromised under
  conditions of environment misalignment. In this paper, we investigate two challenging
  conditions for environment misalignment: Cross-Domain and Cross-Context by proposing
  four datasets that are designed for these challenges: SimB-Border, SimB-Split, BlenB-Border,
  and BlenB-Split. The datasets cover two domains and two contexts. Using RPCIN as
  a probe, experiments conducted on the combinations of the proposed datasets reveal
  potential weaknesses of the vision-based long-term dynamics prediction model. Furthermore,
  we propose a promising direction to mitigate the Cross-Domain challenge and provide
  concrete evidence supporting such a direction, which provides dramatic alleviation
  of the challenge on the proposed datasets.'
