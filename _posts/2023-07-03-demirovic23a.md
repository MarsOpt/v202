title: 'Blossom: an Anytime Algorithm for Computing Optimal Decision Trees'
openreview: 0rO3nlTlbG
abstract: We propose a simple algorithm to learn optimal decision trees of bounded
  depth. This algorithm is essentially an anytime version of the state-of-the-art
  dynamic programming approach. It has virtually no overhead compared to heuristic
  methods and is comparable to the best exact methods to prove optimality on most
  data sets. Experiments show that whereas existing exact methods hardly scale to
  deep trees, this algorithm learns trees comparable to standard heuristics without
  computational overhead, and can significantly improve their accuracy when given
  more computation time, even for deep trees.
