title: On the Convergence of SARSA with Linear Function Approximation
openreview: SuBZ98IyJO
abstract: 'SARSA, a classical on-policy control algorithm for reinforcement learning,
  is known to chatter when combined with linear function approximation: SARSA does
  not diverge but oscillates in a bounded region. However, little is known about how
  fast SARSA converges to that region and how large the region is. In this paper,
  we make progress towards this open problem by showing the convergence rate of projected
  SARSA to a bounded region. Importantly, the region is much smaller than the region
  that we project into, provided that the the magnitude of the reward is not too large.
  Existing works regarding the convergence of linear SARSA to a fixed point all require
  the Lipschitz constant of SARSAâ€™s policy improvement operator to be sufficiently
  small; our analysis instead applies to arbitrary Lipschitz constants and thus characterizes
  the behavior of linear SARSA for a new regime.'
