title: Featured Graph Coarsening with Similarity Guarantees
openreview: wVGreJ2338
abstract: Graph coarsening is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to learn
  a smaller-tractable graph while preserving the properties of the original input
  graph. However, many real-world graphs also have features or contexts associated
  with each node. The existing graph coarsening methods do not consider the node features
  and rely solely on a graph matrix(e.g., adjacency and Laplacian) to coarsen graphs.
  However, some recent deep learning-based graph coarsening methods are designed for
  specific tasks considering both node features and graph matrix. In this paper, we
  introduce a novel optimization-based framework for graph coarsening that takes both
  the graph matrix and the node features as the input and jointly learns the coarsened
  graph matrix and the coarsened feature matrix while ensuring desired properties.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that guarantees that the learned
  coarsened graph is $\epsilon\in[0,1)$ similar to the original graph. Extensive experiments
  with both real and synthetic benchmark datasets elucidate the proposed frameworkâ€™s
  efficacy and applicability for numerous graph-based applications, including graph
  clustering, node classification, stochastic block model identification, and graph
  summarization.
