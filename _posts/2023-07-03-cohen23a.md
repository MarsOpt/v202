title: Sequential Strategic Screening
openreview: uBuWtVGF3h
abstract: 'We initiate the study of strategic behavior in screening processes with
  multiple classifiers. We focus on two contrasting settings: a "conjunctive” setting
  in which an individual must satisfy all classifiers simultaneously, and a sequential
  setting in which an individual to succeed must satisfy classifiers one at a time.
  In other words, we introduce the combination of strategic classificationwith screening
  processes. We show that sequential screening pipelines exhibit new and surprising
  behavior where individuals can exploit the sequential ordering of the tests to "zig-zag”
  between classifiers without having to simultaneously satisfy all of them. We demonstrate
  an individual can obtain a positive outcome using a limited manipulation budget
  even when far from the intersection of the positive regions of every classifier.
  Finally, we consider a learner whose goal is to design a sequential screening process
  that is robust to such manipulations, and provide a construction for the learner
  that optimizes a natural objective.'
