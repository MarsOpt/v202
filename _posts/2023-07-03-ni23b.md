title: 'LEVER: Learning to Verify Language-to-Code Generation with Execution'
openreview: Gj3zN9zs4v
abstract: The advent of large language models trained on code (code LLMs) has led
  to significant progress in language-to-code generation. State-of-the-art approaches
  in this area combine LLM decoding with sample pruning and reranking using test cases
  or heuristics based on the execution results. However, it is challenging to obtain
  test cases for many real-world language-to-code applications, and heuristics cannot
  well capture the semantic features of the execution results, such as data type and
  value range, which often indicates the correctness of the program. In this work,
  we propose LEVER, a simple approach to improve language-to-code generation by learning
  to verify the generated programs with their execution results. Specifically, we
  train verifiers to determine whether a program sampled from the LLMs is correct
  or not based on the natural language input, the program itself and its execution
  results. The sampled programs are reranked by combining the verification score with
  the LLM generation probability, and marginalizing over programs with the same execution
  results. On four datasets across the domains of table QA, math QA and basic Python
  programming, LEVER consistently improves over the base code LLMs (4.6% to 10.9%
  with code-davinci-002) and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them.
