title: Deep Temporal Sets with Evidential Reinforced Attentions for Unique Behavioral
  Pattern Discovery
openreview: aaI18lTgjr
abstract: Machine learning-driven human behavior analysis is gaining attention in
  behavioral/mental healthcare, due to its potential to identify behavioral patterns
  that cannot be recognized by traditional assessments. Real-life applications, such
  as digital behavioral biomarker identification, often require the discovery of complex
  spatiotemporal patterns in multimodal data, which is largely under-explored. To
  fill this gap, we propose a novel model that integrates uniquely designed Deep Temporal
  Sets (DTS) with Evidential Reinforced Attentions (ERA). DTS captures complex temporal
  relationships in the input and generates a set-based representation, while ERA captures
  the policy networkâ€™s uncertainty and conducts evidence-aware exploration to locate
  attentive regions in behavioral data. Using child-computer interaction data as a
  testing platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DTS-ERA in differentiating
  children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and typically developing children based on
  sequential multimodal visual and touch behaviors. Comparisons with baseline methods
  show that our model achieves superior performance and has the potential to provide
  objective, quantitative, and precise analysis of complex human behaviors.
