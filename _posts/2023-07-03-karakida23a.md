title: 'Understanding Gradient Regularization in Deep Learning: Efficient Finite-Difference
  Computation and Implicit Bias'
openreview: Ug2RRD5Pf3
abstract: Gradient regularization (GR) is a method that penalizes the gradient norm
  of the training loss during training. While some studies have reported that GR can
  improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the
  algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve
  the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference
  computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational
  cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better
  in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable
  model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias
  to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias.
  Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based
  on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular,
  we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit
  way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.
