title: Learning Lightweight Object Detectors via Multi-Teacher Progressive Distillation
openreview: euCN0Xz5e9
abstract: Resource-constrained perception systems such as edge computing and vision-for-robotics
  require vision models to be both accurate and lightweight in computation and memory
  usage. While knowledge distillation is a proven strategy to enhance the performance
  of lightweight classification models, its application to structured outputs like
  object detection and instance segmentation remains a complicated task, due to the
  variability in outputs and complex internal network modules involved in the distillation
  process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effective sequential
  approach to knowledge distillation that progressively transfers the knowledge of
  a set of teacher detectors to a given lightweight student. To distill knowledge
  from a highly accurate but complex teacher model, we construct a sequence of teachers
  to help the student gradually adapt. Our progressive strategy can be easily combined
  with existing detection distillation mechanisms to consistently maximize student
  performance in various settings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
  to successfully distill knowledge from Transformer-based teacher detectors to convolution-based
  students, and unprecedentedly boost the performance of ResNet-50 based RetinaNet
  from 36.5% to 42.0% AP and Mask R-CNN from 38.2% to 42.5% AP on the MS COCO benchmark.
