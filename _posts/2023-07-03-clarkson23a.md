title: Distribution Free Prediction Sets for Node Classification
openreview: 1e80ooimrm
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are able to achieve high classification accuracy
  on many important real world datasets, but provide no rigorous notion of predictive
  uncertainty. Quantifying the confidence of GNN models is difficult due to the dependence
  between datapoints induced by the graph structure. We leverage recent advances in
  conformal prediction to construct prediction sets for node classification in inductive
  learning scenarios. We do this by taking an existing approach for conformal classification
  that relies on <em>exchangeable</em> data and modifying it by appropriately weighting
  the conformal scores to reflect the network structure. We show through experiments
  on standard benchmark datasets using popular GNN models that our approach provides
  tighter and better calibrated prediction sets than a naive application of conformal
  prediction.
