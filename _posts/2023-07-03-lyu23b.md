title: Pairwise Ranking Losses of Click-Through Rates Prediction for Welfare Maximization
  in Ad Auctions
openreview: KKaTURYcKG
abstract: We study the design of loss functions for click-through rates (CTR) to optimize
  (social) welfare in advertising auctions. Existing works either only focus on CTR
  predictions without consideration of business objectives (e.g., welfare) in auctions
  or assume that the distribution over the participants’ expected cost-per-impression
  (eCPM) is known a priori, then use various additional assumptions on the parametric
  form of the distribution to derive loss functions for predicting CTRs. In this work,
  we bring back the welfare objectives of ad auctions into CTR predictions and propose
  a novel weighted rankloss to train the CTR model. Compared to existing literature,
  our approach provides a provable guarantee on welfare but without assumptions on
  the eCPMs’ distribution while also avoiding the intractability of naively applying
  existing learning-to-rank methods. Further, we propose a theoretically justifiable
  technique for calibrating the losses using labels generated from a teacher network,
  only assuming that the teacher network has bounded $\ell_2$ generalization error.
  Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed loss on synthetic and real-world
  data.
