title: On Balancing Bias and Variance in Unsupervised Multi-Source-Free Domain Adaptation
openreview: jWFRFz7yIc
abstract: Due to privacy, storage, and other constraints, there is a growing need
  for unsupervised domain adaptation techniques in machine learning that do not require
  access to the data used to train a collection of source models. Existing methods
  for multi-source-free domain adaptation (MSFDA) typically train a target model using
  pseudo-labeled data produced by the source models, which focus on improving the
  pseudo-labeling techniques or proposing new training objectives. Instead, we aim
  to analyze the fundamental limits of MSFDA. In particular, we develop an information-theoretic
  bound on the generalization error of the resulting target model, which illustrates
  an inherent bias-variance trade-off. We then provide insights on how to balance
  this trade-off from three perspectives, including domain aggregation, selective
  pseudo-labeling, and joint feature alignment, which leads to the design of novel
  algorithms. Experiments on multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and
  demonstrate the state-of-art performance of the proposed algorithm, especially on
  some of the most challenging datasets, including Office-Home and DomainNet.
