title: A/B Testing in Network Data with Covariate-Adaptive Randomization
openreview: 9wP94EI8mk
abstract: Users linked together through a network often tend to have similar behaviors.
  This phenomenon is usually known as network interaction. Usersâ€™ characteristics,
  the covariates, are often correlated with their outcomes. Therefore, one should
  incorporate both the covariates and the network information in a carefully designed
  randomization to improve the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE) in
  network A/B testing. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive procedure to balance
  both the network and the covariates. We show that the imbalance measures with respect
  to the covariates and the network are $O_p(1)$. We also demonstrate the relationships
  between the improved balances and the increased efficiency in terms of the mean
  square error (MSE). Numerical studies demonstrate the advanced performance of the
  proposed procedure regarding the greater comparability of the treatment groups and
  the reduction of MSE for estimating the ATE.
