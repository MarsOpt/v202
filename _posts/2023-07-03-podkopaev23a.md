title: Sequential Kernelized Independence Testing
openreview: pKz0SD05YC
abstract: 'Independence testing is a classical statistical problem that has been extensively
  studied in the batch setting when one fixes the sample size before collecting data.
  However, practitioners often prefer procedures that adapt to the complexity of a
  problem at hand instead of setting sample size in advance. Ideally, such procedures
  should (a) stop earlier on easy tasks (and later on harder tasks), hence making
  better use of available resources, and (b) continuously monitor the data and efficiently
  incorporate statistical evidence after collecting new data, while controlling the
  false alarm rate. Classical batch tests are not tailored for streaming data: valid
  inference after data peeking requires correcting for multiple testing which results
  in low power. Following the principle of testing by betting, we design sequential
  kernelized independence tests that overcome such shortcomings. We exemplify our
  broad framework using bets inspired by kernelized dependence measures, e.g., the
  Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. Our test is also valid under non-i.i.d.
  time-varying settings. We demonstrate the power of our approaches on both simulated
  and real data.'
