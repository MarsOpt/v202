title: Learning Neural Constitutive Laws from Motion Observations for Generalizable
  PDE Dynamics
openreview: 7GD5BMI3km
abstract: We propose a hybrid neural network (NN) and PDE approach for learning generalizable
  PDE dynamics from motion observations. Many NN approaches learn an end-to-end model
  that implicitly models both the governing PDE and constitutive models (or material
  models). Without explicit PDE knowledge, these approaches cannot guarantee physical
  correctness and have limited generalizability. We argue that the governing PDEs
  are often well-known and should be explicitly enforced rather than learned. Instead,
  constitutive models are particularly suitable for learning due to their data-fitting
  nature. To this end, we introduce a new framework termed "Neural Constitutive Laws"
  (NCLaw), which utilizes a network architecture that strictly guarantees standard
  constitutive priors, including rotation equivariance and undeformed state equilibrium.
  We embed this network inside a differentiable simulation and train the model by
  minimizing a loss function based on the difference between the simulation and the
  motion observation. We validate NCLaw on various large-deformation dynamical systems,
  ranging from solids to fluids. After training on a single motion trajectory, our
  method generalizes to new geometries, initial/boundary conditions, temporal ranges,
  and even multi-physics systems. On these extremely out-of-distribution generalization
  tasks, NCLaw is orders-of-magnitude more accurate than previous NN approaches. Real-world
  experiments demonstrate our methodâ€™s ability to learn constitutive laws from videos.
