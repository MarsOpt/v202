title: Structural Re-weighting Improves Graph Domain Adaptation
openreview: fKnw2yYXpK
abstract: In many real-world applications, graph-structured data used for training
  and testing have differences in distribution, such as in high energy physics (HEP)
  where simulation data used for training may not match real experiments. Graph domain
  adaptation (GDA) is a method used to address these differences. However, current
  GDA primarily works by aligning the distributions of node representations output
  by a single graph neural network encoder shared across the training and testing
  domains, which may often yield sub-optimal solutions. This work examines different
  impacts of distribution shifts caused by either graph structure or node attributes
  and identifies a new type of shift, named conditional structure shift (CSS), which
  current GDA approaches are provably sub-optimal to deal with. A novel approach,
  called structural reweighting (StruRW), is proposed to address this issue and is
  tested on synthetic graphs, four benchmark datasets, and a new application in HEP.
  StruRW has shown significant performance improvement over the baselines in the settings
  with large graph structure shifts, and reasonable performance improvement when node
  attribute shift dominates.
