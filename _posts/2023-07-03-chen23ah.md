title: 'Learning to Incentivize Information Acquisition: Proper Scoring Rules Meet
  Principal-Agent Model'
openreview: xDIppoiFrA
abstract: We study the incentivized information acquisition problem, where a principal
  hires an agent to gather information on her behalf. Such a problem is modeled as
  a Stackelberg game between the principal and the agent, where the principal announces
  a scoring rule that specifies the payment, and then the agent then chooses an effort
  level that maximizes her own profit and reports the information. We study the online
  setting of such a problem from the principal’s perspective, i.e., designing the
  optimal scoring rule by repeatedly interacting with the strategic agent. We design
  a provably sample efficient algorithm that tailors the UCB algorithm (Auer et al.,
  2002) to our model, which achieves a $\mathcal{O} (K^2\cdot T^{2/3})$ regret after
  $T$ iterations, where $K$ is the number of effort levels of the agent. Our algorithm
  features a delicate estimation procedure for the optimal profit of the principal,
  and a conservative correction scheme that ensures the desired agent’s actions are
  incentivized. Furthermore, a key feature of our regret bound is that it is independent
  of the number of states of the environment.
