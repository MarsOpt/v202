title: Adaptive Whitening in Neural Populations with Gain-modulating Interneurons
openreview: cEWB5hABV5
abstract: Statistical whitening transformations play a fundamental role in many computational
  systems, and may also play an important role in biological sensory systems. Existing
  neural circuit models of adaptive whitening operate by modifying synaptic interactions;
  however, such modifications would seem both too slow and insufficiently reversible.
  Motivated by the extensive neuroscience literature on gain modulation, we propose
  an alternative model that adaptively whitens its responses by modulating the gains
  of individual neurons. Starting from a novel whitening objective, we derive an online
  algorithm that whitens its outputs by adjusting the marginal variances of an overcomplete
  set of projections. We map the algorithm onto a recurrent neural network with fixed
  synaptic weights and gain-modulating interneurons. We demonstrate numerically that
  sign-constraining the gains improves robustness of the network to ill-conditioned
  inputs, and a generalization of the circuit achieves a form of local whitening in
  convolutional populations, such as those found throughout the visual or auditory
  systems.
