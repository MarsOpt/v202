title: 'Meta-SAGE: Scale Meta-Learning Scheduled Adaptation with Guided Exploration
  for Mitigating Scale Shift on Combinatorial Optimization'
openreview: DZvwV3Z4Z8
abstract: 'This paper proposes Meta-SAGE, a novel approach for improving the scalability
  of deep reinforcement learning models for combinatorial optimization (CO) tasks.
  Our method adapts pre-trained models to larger-scale problems in test time by suggesting
  two components: a scale meta-learner (SML) and scheduled adaptation with guided
  exploration (SAGE). First, SML transforms the context embedding for subsequent adaptation
  of SAGE based on scale information. Then, SAGE adjusts the model parameters dedicated
  to the context embedding for a specific instance. SAGE introduces locality bias,
  which encourages selecting nearby locations to determine the next location. The
  locality bias gradually decays as the model is adapted to the target instance. Results
  show that Meta-SAGE outperforms previous adaptation methods and significantly improves
  scalability in representative CO tasks. Our source code is available at https://github.com/kaist-silab/meta-sage.'
