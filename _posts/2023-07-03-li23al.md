title: 'Transcendental Idealism of Planner: Evaluating Perception from Planning Perspective
  for Autonomous Driving'
openreview: O0G4GsQ3Jy
abstract: Evaluating the performance of perception modules in autonomous driving is
  one of the most critical tasks in developing the complex intelligent system. While
  module-level unit test metrics adopted from traditional computer vision tasks are
  feasible to some extent, it remains far less explored to measure the impact of perceptual
  noise on the driving quality of autonomous vehicles in a consistent and holistic
  manner. In this work, we propose a principled framework that provides a coherent
  and systematic understanding of the impact an error in the perception module imposes
  on an autonomous agentâ€™s planning that actually controls the vehicle. Specifically,
  the planning process is formulated as expected utility maximisation, where all input
  signals from upstream modules jointly provide a world state description, and the
  planner strives for the optimal action by maximising the expected utility determined
  by both world states and actions. We show that, under practical conditions, the
  objective function can be represented as an inner product between the world state
  description and the utility function in a Hilbert space. This geometric interpretation
  enables a novel way to analyse the impact of noise in world state estimation on
  planning and leads to a universal metric for evaluating perception. The whole framework
  resembles the idea of transcendental idealism in the classical philosophical literature,
  which gives the name to our approach.
