title: Nearly-Linear Time and Streaming Algorithms for Outlier-Robust PCA
openreview: 1RFpQOU8Jv
abstract: We study principal component analysis (PCA), where given a dataset in $\mathbb
  R^d$ from a distribution, the task is to find a unit vector $v$ that approximately
  maximizes the variance of the distribution after being projected along $v$. Despite
  being a classical task, standard estimators fail drastically if the data contains
  even a small fraction of outliers, motivating the problem of robust PCA. Recent
  work has developed computationally-efficient algorithms for robust PCA that either
  take super-linear time or have sub-optimal error guarantees. Our main contribution
  is to develop a nearly linear time algorithm for robust PCA with near-optimal error
  guarantees. We also develop a single-pass streaming algorithm for robust PCA with
  memory usage nearly-linear in the dimension.
