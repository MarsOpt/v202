title: Optimal Convergence Rates for Agnostic Nyström Kernel Learning
openreview: S3d9SwhRKh
abstract: Nyström low-rank approximation has shown great potential in processing large-scale
  kernel matrix and neural networks. However, there lacks a unified analysis for Nyström
  approximation, and the asymptotical minimax optimality for Nyström methods usually
  require a strict condition, assuming that the target regression lies exactly in
  the hypothesis space. In this paper, to tackle these problems, we provide a refined
  generalization analysis for Nyström approximation in the agnostic setting, where
  the target regression may be out of the hypothesis space. Specifically, we show
  Nyström approximation can still achieve the capacity-dependent optimal rates in
  the agnostic setting. To this end, we first prove the capacity-dependent optimal
  guarantees of Nyström approximation with the standard uniform sampling, which covers
  both loss functions and applies to some agnostic settings. Then, using data-dependent
  sampling, for example, leverage scores sampling, we derive the capacity-dependent
  optimal rates that apply to the whole range of the agnostic setting. To our best
  knowledge, the capacity-dependent optimality for the whole range of the agnostic
  setting is first achieved and novel in Nyström approximation.
