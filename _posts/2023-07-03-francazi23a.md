title: A Theoretical Analysis of the Learning Dynamics under Class Imbalance
openreview: jNpmHrHVWZ
abstract: 'Data imbalance is a common problem in machine learning that can have a
  critical effect on the performance of a model. Various solutions exist but their
  impact on the convergence of the learning dynamics is not understood. Here, we elucidate
  the significant negative impact of data imbalance on learning, showing that the
  learning curves for minority and majority classes follow sub-optimal trajectories
  when training with a gradient-based optimizer. This slowdown is related to the imbalance
  ratio and can be traced back to a competition between the optimization of different
  classes. Our main contribution is the analysis of the convergence of full-batch
  (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and of variants that renormalize the
  contribution of each per-class gradient. We find that GD is not guaranteed to decrease
  the loss for each class but that this problem can be addressed by performing a per-class
  normalization of the gradient. With SGD, class imbalance has an additional effect
  on the direction of the gradients: the minority class suffers from a higher directional
  noise, which reduces the effectiveness of the per-class gradient normalization.
  Our findings not only allow us to understand the potential and limitations of strategies
  involving the per-class gradients, but also the reason for the effectiveness of
  previously used solutions for class imbalancesuch as oversampling.'
