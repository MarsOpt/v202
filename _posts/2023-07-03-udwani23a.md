title: Submodular Order Functions and Assortment Optimization
openreview: fNMbV07iv7
abstract: We define a new class of set functions that in addition to being monotone
  and subadditive, also admit a very limited form of submodularity defined over a
  permutation of the ground set. We refer to this permutation as a submodular order.
  We give fast algorithms with strong approximation guarantees for maximizing submodular
  order functions under a variety of constraints. Applying this new notion to the
  problem of constrained assortment optimization in fundamental choice models, we
  obtain new algorithms that are both faster and have stronger approximation guarantees
  (in some cases, first algorithm with constant factor guarantee). We also show an
  intriguing connection to the maximization of monotone submodular functions in the
  streaming model, where we recover best known approximation guarantees as a corollary
  of our results.
