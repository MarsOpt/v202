title: 'Semi-Autoregressive Energy Flows: Exploring Likelihood-Free Training of Normalizing
  Flows'
openreview: Skrk3StS2g
abstract: Training normalizing flow generative models can be challenging due to the
  need to calculate computationally expensive determinants of Jacobians. This paper
  studies the likelihood-free training of flows and proposes the energy objective,
  an alternative sample-based loss based on proper scoring rules. The energy objective
  is determinant-free and supports flexible model architectures that are not easily
  compatible with maximum likelihood training, including semi-autoregressive energy
  flows, a novel model family that interpolates between fully autoregressive and non-autoregressive
  models. Energy flows feature competitive sample quality, posterior inference, and
  generation speed relative to likelihood-based flows; this performance is decorrelated
  from the quality of log-likelihood estimates, which are generally very poor. Our
  findings question the use of maximum likelihood as an objective or a metric, and
  contribute to a scientific study of its role in generative modeling. Code is available
