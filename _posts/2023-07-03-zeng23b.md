title: Attribute-Efficient PAC Learning of Low-Degree Polynomial Threshold Functions
  with Nasty Noise
openreview: 6pFhUYPlvF
abstract: 'The concept class of low-degree polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) plays
  a fundamental role in machine learning. In this paper, we study PAC learning of
  $K$-sparse degree-$d$ PTFs on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where any such concept depends only
  on $K$ out of $n$ attributes of the input. Our main contribution is a new algorithm
  that runs in time $({nd}/{\epsilon})^{O(d)}$ and under the Gaussian marginal distribution,
  PAC learns the class up to error rate $\epsilon$ with $O(\frac{K^{4d}}{\epsilon^{2d}}
  \cdot \log^{5d} n)$ samples even when an $\eta \leq O(\epsilon^d)$ fraction of them
  are corrupted by the nasty noise of Bshouty et al. (2002), possibly the strongest
  corruption model. Prior to this work, attribute-efficient robust algorithms are
  established only for the special case of sparse homogeneous halfspaces. Our key
  ingredients are: 1) a structural result that translates the attribute sparsity to
  a sparsity pattern of the Chow vector under the basis of Hermite polynomials, and
  2) a novel attribute-efficient robust Chow vector estimation algorithm which uses
  exclusively a restricted Frobenius norm to either certify a good approximation or
  to validate a sparsity-induced degree-$2d$ polynomial as a filter to detect corrupted
  samples.'
