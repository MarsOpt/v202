title: Why Target Networks Stabilise Temporal Difference Methods
openreview: kjyXxKw4uI
abstract: 'Integral to recent successes in deep reinforcement learning has been a
  class of temporal difference methods that use infrequently updated target values
  for policy evaluation in a Markov Decision Process. Yet a complete theoretical explanation
  for the effectiveness of target networks remains elusive. In this work, we provide
  an analysis of this popular class of algorithms, to finally answer the question:
  “why do target networks stabilise TD learning”? To do so, we formalise the notion
  of a partially fitted policy evaluation method, which describes the use of target
  networks and bridges the gap between fitted methods and semigradient temporal difference
  algorithms. Using this framework we are able to uniquely characterise the so-called
  deadly triad–the use of TD updates with (nonlinear) function approximation and off-policy
  data–which often leads to nonconvergent algorithms.This insight leads us to conclude
  that the use of target networks can mitigate the effects of poor conditioning in
  the Jacobian of the TD update. Instead, we show that under mild regularity con-
  ditions and a well tuned target network update frequency, convergence can be guaranteed
  even in the extremely challenging off-policy sampling and nonlinear function approximation
  setting.'
