title: Proper Losses for Discrete Generative Models
openreview: VVdb1la0cW
abstract: 'We initiate the study of proper losses for evaluating generative models
  in the discrete setting. Unlike traditional proper losses, we treat both the generative
  model and the target distribution as black-boxes, only assuming ability to draw
  i.i.d. samples. We define a loss to be black-box proper if the generative distribution
  that minimizes expected loss is equal to the target distribution. Using techniques
  from statistical estimation theory, we give a general construction and characterization
  of black-box proper losses: they must take a polynomial form, and the number of
  draws from the model and target distribution must exceed the degree of the polynomial.
  The characterization rules out a loss whose expectation is the cross-entropy between
  the target distribution and the model. By extending the construction to arbitrary
  sampling schemes such as Poisson sampling, however, we show that one can construct
  such a loss.'
