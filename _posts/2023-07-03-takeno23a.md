title: Randomized Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound with Tighter Bayesian Regret
  Bounds
openreview: z6UjervUws
abstract: Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) is a theoretically promising
  approach for black-box optimization; however, the confidence parameter $\beta$ is
  considerably large in the theorem and chosen heuristically in practice. Then, randomized
  GP-UCB (RGP-UCB) uses a randomized confidence parameter, which follows the Gamma
  distribution, to mitigate the impact of manually specifying $\beta$. This study
  first generalizes the regret analysis of RGP-UCB to a wider class of distributions,
  including the Gamma distribution. Furthermore, we propose improved RGP-UCB (IRGP-UCB)
  based on a two-parameter exponential distribution, which achieves tighter Bayesian
  regret bounds. IRGP-UCB does not require an increase in the confidence parameter
  in terms of the number of iterations, which avoids over-exploration in the later
  iterations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IRGP-UCB through extensive
  experiments.
