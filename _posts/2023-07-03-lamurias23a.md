title: Metagenomic Binning using Connectivity-constrained Variational Autoencoders
openreview: id8OSRGeew
abstract: Current state-of-the-art techniques for metagenomic binning only utilize
  local features for the individual DNA sequences (contigs), neglecting additional
  information such as the assembly graph, in which the contigs are connected according
  to overlapping reads, and gene markers identified in the contigs. In this paper,
  we propose the use of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) tailored to leverage auxiliary
  structural information about contig relations when learning contig representations
  for subsequent metagenomic binning. Our method, CCVAE, improves on previous work
  that used VAEs for learning latent representations of the individual contigs, by
  constraining these representations according to the connectivity information from
  the assembly graph. Additionally, we incorporate into the model additional information
  in the form of marker genes to better differentiate contigs from different genomes.
  Our experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CCVAE
  outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, thus providing a more effective
  method for metagenomic binning.
