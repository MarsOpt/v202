title: Conformalization of Sparse Generalized Linear Models
openreview: u1fhtP15l5
abstract: Given a sequence of observable variables $\{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$,
  the conformal prediction method estimates a confidence set for $y_{n+1}$ given $x_{n+1}$
  that is valid for any finite sample size by merely assuming that the joint distribution
  of the data is permutation invariant. Although attractive, computing such a set
  is computationally infeasible in most regression problems. Indeed, in these cases,
  the unknown variable $y_{n+1}$ can take an infinite number of possible candidate
  values, and generating conformal sets requires retraining a predictive model for
  each candidate. In this paper, we focus on a sparse linear model with only a subset
  of variables for prediction and use numerical continuation techniques to approximate
  the solution path efficiently. The critical property we exploit is that the set
  of selected variables is invariant under a small perturbation of the input data.
  Therefore, it is sufficient to enumerate and refit the model only at the change
  points of the set of active features and smoothly interpolate the rest of the solution
  via a Predictor-Corrector mechanism. We show how our path-following algorithm accurately
  approximates conformal prediction sets and illustrate its performance using synthetic
  and real data examples.
