title: On the Identifiability and Estimation of Causal Location-Scale Noise Models
openreview: hWBcKXjVzl
abstract: 'We study the class of location-scale or heteroscedastic noise models (LSNMs),
  in which the effect $Y$ can be written as a function of the cause $X$ and a noise
  source $N$ independent of $X$, which may be scaled by a positive function $g$ over
  the cause, i.e., $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$. Despite the generality of the model class,
  we show the causal direction is identifiable up to some pathological cases. To empirically
  validate these theoretical findings, we propose two estimators for LSNMs: an estimator
  based on (non-linear) feature maps, and one based on neural networks. Both model
  the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ as a Gaussian parameterized by its
  natural parameters. When the feature maps are correctly specified, we prove that
  our estimator is jointly concave, and a consistent estimator for the cause-effect
  identification task. Although the the neural network does not inherit those guarantees,
  it can fit functions of arbitrary complexity, and reaches state-of-the-art performance
  across benchmarks.'
