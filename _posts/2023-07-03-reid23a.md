title: Simplex Random Features
openreview: qw8zAw6mzJ
abstract: We present Simplex Random Features (SimRFs), a new random feature (RF) mechanism
  for unbiased approximation of the softmax and Gaussian kernels by geometrical correlation
  of random projection vectors. We prove that SimRFs provide the smallest possible
  mean square error (MSE) on unbiased estimates of these kernels among the class of
  weight-independent geometrically-coupled positive random feature (PRF) mechanisms,
  substantially outperforming the previously most accurate Orthogonal Random Features
  (ORFs) at no observable extra cost. We present a more computationally expensive
  SimRFs+ variant, which we prove is asymptotically optimal in the broader family
  of weight-dependent geometrical coupling schemes (which permit correlations between
  random vector directions and norms). In extensive empirical studies, we show consistent
  gains provided by SimRFs in settings including pointwise kernel estimation, nonparametric
  classification and scalable Transformers.
