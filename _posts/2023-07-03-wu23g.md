title: A Law of Robustness beyond Isoperimetry
openreview: jky0AfLHir
abstract: 'We study the robust interpolation problem of arbitrary data distributions
  supported on a bounded space and propose a two-fold law of robustness. Robust interpolation
  refers to the problem of interpolating $n$ noisy training data points in $R^d$ by
  a Lipschitz function. Although this problem has been well understood when the samples
  are drawn from an isoperimetry distribution, much remains unknown concerning its
  performance under generic or even the worst-case distributions. We prove a Lipschitzness
  lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{n/p})$ of the interpolating neural network with $p$ parameters
  on arbitrary data distributions. With this result, we validate the law of robustness
  conjecture in prior work by Bubeck, Li and Nagaraj on two-layer neural networks
  with polynomial weights. We then extend our result to arbitrary interpolating approximators
  and prove a Lipschitzness lower bound $\Omega(n^{1/d})$ for robust interpolation.
  Our results demonstrate a two-fold law of robustness: a) we show the potential benefit
  of overparametrization for smooth data interpolation when $n=poly(d)$, and b) we
  disprove the potential existence of an $O(1)$-Lipschitz robust interpolating function
  when $n=\exp(\omega(d))$.'
