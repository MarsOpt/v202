title: Federated Linear Contextual Bandits with User-level Differential Privacy
openreview: b9opfVNw6O
abstract: This paper studies federated linear contextual bandits under the notion
  of user-level differential privacy (DP). We first introduce a unified federated
  bandits framework that can accommodate various definitions of DP in the sequential
  decision-making setting. We then formally introduce user-level central DP (CDP)
  and local DP (LDP) in the federated bandits framework, and investigate the fundamental
  trade-offs between the learning regrets and the corresponding DP guarantees in a
  federated linear contextual bandits model. For CDP, we propose a federated algorithm
  termed as $\texttt{ROBIN}$ and show that it is near-optimal in terms of the number
  of clients $M$ and the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ by deriving nearly-matching
  upper and lower regret bounds when user-level DP is satisfied. For LDP, we obtain
  several lower bounds, indicating that learning under user-level $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-LDP
  must suffer a regret blow-up factor at least $\min\{1/\varepsilon,M\}$ or $\min\{1/\sqrt{\varepsilon},\sqrt{M}\}$
  under different conditions.
