title: Sharper Bounds for $\ell_p$ Sensitivity Sampling
openreview: 3onrj9ua4l
abstract: In large scale machine learning, <em>random sampling</em> is a popular way
  to approximate datasets by a small representative subset of examples. In particular,
  <em>sensitivity sampling</em> is an intensely studied technique which provides provable
  guarantees on the quality of approximation, while reducing the number of examples
  to the product of the <em>VC dimension</em> $d$ and the <em>total sensitivity</em>
  $\mathfrak{S}$ in remarkably general settings. However, guarantees going beyond
  this general bound of $\mathfrak{S} d$ are known in perhaps only one setting, for
  <em>$\ell_2$ subspace embeddings</em>, despite intense study of sensitivity sampling
  in prior work. In this work, we show the first bounds for sensitivity sampling for
  $\ell_p$ subspace embeddings for $p\neq 2$ that improve over the general $\mathfrak{S}
  d$ bound, achieving a bound of roughly $\mathfrak{S}^{2/p}$ for $1\leq p<2$ and
  $\mathfrak{S}^{2-2/p}$ for $2<p<\infty$. For $1\leq p<2$, we show that this bound
  is tight, in the sense that there exist matrices for which $\mathfrak{S}^{2/p}$
  samples is necessary. Furthermore, our techniques yield further new results in the
  study of sampling algorithms, showing that the <em>root leverage score sampling</em>
  algorithm achieves a bound of roughly $d$ for $1\leq p<2$, and that a combination
  of leverage score and sensitivity sampling achieves an improved bound of roughly
  $d^{2/p}\mathfrak{S}^{2-4/p}$ for $2<p<\infty$. Our sensitivity sampling results
  yield the best known sample complexity for a wide class of structured matrices that
  have small $\ell_p$ sensitivity.
