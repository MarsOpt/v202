title: Weak Proxies are Sufficient and Preferable for Fairness with Missing Sensitive
  Attributes
openreview: l7BJBfaCVm
abstract: 'Evaluating fairness can be challenging in practice because the sensitive
  attributes of data are often inaccessible due to privacy constraints. The go-to
  approach that the industry frequently adopts is using off-the-shelf proxy models
  to predict the missing sensitive attributes, e.g. Meta (Alao et al., 2021) and Twitter
  (Belli et al., 2022). Despite its popularity, there are three important questions
  unanswered: (1) Is directly using proxies efficacious in measuring fairness? (2)
  If not, is it possible to accurately evaluate fairness using proxies only? (3) Given
  the ethical controversy over infer-ring user private information, is it possible
  to only use weak (i.e. inaccurate) proxies in order to protect privacy? Our theoretical
  analyses show that directly using proxy models can give a false sense of (un)fairness.
  Second, we develop an algorithm that is able to measure fairness (provably) accurately
  with only three properly identified proxies. Third, we show that our algorithm allows
  the use of only weak proxies (e.g. with only 68.85% accuracy on COMPAS), adding
  an extra layer of protection on user privacy. Experiments validate our theoretical
  analyses and show our algorithm can effectively measure and mitigate bias. Our results
  imply a set of practical guidelines for prac-titioners on how to use proxies properly.
