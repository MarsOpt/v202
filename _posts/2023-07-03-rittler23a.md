title: A Two-Stage Active Learning Algorithm for k-Nearest Neighbors
openreview: UOyczqYEU7
abstract: "$k$-nearest neighbor classification is a popular non-parametric method
  because of desirable properties like automatic adaption to distributional scale
  changes. Unfortunately, it has thus far proved difficult to design active learning
  strategies for the training of local voting-based classifiers that naturally retain
  these desirable properties, and hence active learning strategies for $k$-nearest
  neighbor classification have been conspicuously missing from the literature. In
  this work, we introduce a simple and intuitive active learning algorithm for the
  training of $k$-nearest neighbor classifiers, the first in the literature which
  retains the concept of the $k$-nearest neighbor vote at prediction time. We provide
  consistency guarantees for a modified $k$-nearest neighbors classifier trained on
  samples acquired via our scheme, and show that when the conditional probability
  function $\\mathbb{P}(Y=y|X=x)$ is sufficiently smooth and the Tsybakov noise condition
  holds, our actively trained classifiers converge to the Bayes optimal classifier
  at a faster asymptotic rate than passively trained $k$-nearest neighbor classifiers."
