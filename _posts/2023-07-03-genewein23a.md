title: Memory-Based Meta-Learning on Non-Stationary Distributions
openreview: gyHGzyIuEJ
abstract: Memory-based meta-learning is a technique for approximating Bayes-optimal
  predictors. Under fairly general conditions, minimizing sequential prediction error,
  measured by the log loss, leads to implicit meta-learning. The goal of this work
  is to investigate how far this interpretation can be realized by current sequence
  prediction models and training regimes. The focus is on piecewise stationary sources
  with unobserved switching-points, which arguably capture an important characteristic
  of natural language and action-observation sequences in partially observable environments.
  We show that various types of memory-based neural models, including Transformers,
  LSTMs, and RNNs can learn to accurately approximate known Bayes-optimal algorithms
  and behave as if performing Bayesian inference over the latent switching-points
  and the latent parameters governing the data distribution within each segment.
