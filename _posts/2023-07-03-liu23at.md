title: Online Nonstochastic Control with Adversarial and Static Constraints
openreview: ecrYUkXzOs
abstract: This paper studies online nonstochastic control problems with adversarial
  and static constraints. We propose online nonstochastic control algorithms that
  achieve both sublinear regret and sublinear adversarial constraint violation while
  keeping static constraint violation minimal against the optimal constrained linear
  control policy in hindsight. To establish the results, we introduce an online convex
  optimization with memory framework under adversarial and static constraints, which
  serves as a subroutine for the constrained online nonstochastic control algorithms.
  This subroutine also achieves the state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation
  bounds for constrained online convex optimization problems, which is of independent
  interest. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed control algorithms are adaptive
  to adversarial constraints and achieve smaller cumulative costs and violations.
  Moreover, our algorithms are less conservative and achieve significantly smaller
  cumulative costs than the state-of-the-art algorithm.
