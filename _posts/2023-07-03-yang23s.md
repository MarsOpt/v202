title: 'Change is Hard: A Closer Look at Subpopulation Shift'
openreview: wwR38qFs3i
abstract: 'Machine learning models often perform poorly on subgroups that are underrepresented
  in the training data. Yet, little is understood on the variation in mechanisms that
  cause subpopulation shifts, and how algorithms generalize across such diverse shifts
  at scale. In this work, we provide a fine-grained analysis of subpopulation shift.
  We first propose a unified framework that dissects and explains common shifts in
  subgroups. We then establish a comprehensive benchmark of 20 state-of-the-art algorithms
  evaluated on 12 real-world datasets in vision, language, and healthcare domains.
  With results obtained from training over 10,000 models, we reveal intriguing observations
  for future progress in this space. First, existing algorithms only improve subgroup
  robustness over certain types of shifts but not others. Moreover, while current
  algorithms rely on group-annotated validation data for model selection, we find
  that a simple selection criterion based on worst-class accuracy is surprisingly
  effective even without any group information. Finally, unlike existing works that
  solely aim to improve worst-group accuracy (WGA), we demonstrate the fundamental
  tradeoff between WGA and other important metrics, highlighting the need to carefully
  choose testing metrics. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/YyzHarry/SubpopBench.'
