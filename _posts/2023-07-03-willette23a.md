title: Scalable Set Encoding with Universal Mini-Batch Consistency and Unbiased Full
  Set Gradient Approximation
openreview: bBk09FBRox
abstract: Recent work on mini-batch consistency (MBC) for set functions has brought
  attention to the need for sequentially processing and aggregating chunks of a partitioned
  set while guaranteeing the same output for all partitions. However, existing constraints
  on MBC architectures lead to models with limited expressive power. Additionally,
  prior work has not addressed how to deal with large sets during training when the
  full set gradient is required. To address these issues, we propose a Universally
  MBC (UMBC) class of set functions which can be used in conjunction with arbitrary
  non-MBC components while still satisfying MBC, enabling a wider range of function
  classes to be used in MBC settings. Furthermore, we propose an efficient MBC training
  algorithm which gives an unbiased approximation of the full set gradient and has
  a constant memory overhead for any set size for both train- and test-time. We conduct
  extensive experiments including image completion, text classification, unsupervised
  clustering, and cancer detection on high-resolution images to verify the efficiency
  and efficacy of our scalable set encoding framework. Our code is available at github.com/jeffwillette/umbc
