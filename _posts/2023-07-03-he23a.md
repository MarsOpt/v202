title: A Generalization of ViT/MLP-Mixer to Graphs
openreview: l7yTbEWuOQ
abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in the field of
  graph representation learning. Standard GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism
  which propagates information over the whole graph domain by stacking multiple layers.
  This paradigm suffers from two major limitations, over-squashing and poor long-range
  dependencies, that can be solved using global attention but significantly increases
  the computational cost to quadratic complexity. In this work, we propose an alternative
  approach to overcome these structural limitations by leveraging the ViT/MLP-Mixer
  architectures introduced in computer vision. We introduce a new class of GNNs, called
  Graph ViT/MLP-Mixer, that holds three key properties. First, they capture long-range
  dependency and mitigate the issue of over-squashing as demonstrated on Long Range
  Graph Benchmark and TreeNeighbourMatch datasets. Second, they offer better speed
  and memory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and edges,
  surpassing the related Graph Transformer and expressive GNN models. Third, they
  show high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism as they can distinguish at
  least 3-WL non-isomorphic graphs. We test our architecture on 4 simulated datasets
  and 7 real-world benchmarks, and show highly competitive results on all of them.
