title: Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Federated Learning via Implicit Invariant
  Relationships
openreview: JC05k0E2EM
abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization is challenging for non-participating
  clients of federated learning under distribution shifts. A proven strategy is to
  explore those invariant relationships between input and target variables, working
  equally well for non-participating clients. However, learning invariant relationships
  is often in an explicit manner from data, representation, and distribution, which
  violates the federated principles of privacy-preserving and limited communication.
  In this paper, we propose FedIIR, which implicitly learns invariant relationships
  from parameter for out-of-distribution generalization, adhering to the above principles.
  Specifically, we utilize the prediction disagreement to quantify invariant relationships
  and implicitly reduce it through inter-client gradient alignment. Theoretically,
  we demonstrate the range of non-participating clients to which FedIIR is expected
  to generalize and present the convergence results for FedIIR in the massively distributed
  with limited communication. Extensive experiments show that FedIIR significantly
  outperforms relevant baselines in terms of out-of-distribution generalization of
  federated learning.
