title: Adversarial Cheap Talk
openreview: 3wxUzU2ZnM
abstract: Adversarial attacks in reinforcement learning (RL) often assume highly-privileged
  access to the victim’s parameters, environment, or data. Instead, this paper proposes
  a novel adversarial setting called a Cheap Talk MDP in which an Adversary can merely
  append deterministic messages to the Victim’s observation, resulting in a minimal
  range of influence. The Adversary cannot occlude ground truth, influence underlying
  environment dynamics or reward signals, introduce non-stationarity, add stochasticity,
  see the Victim’s actions, or access their parameters. Additionally, we present a
  simple meta-learning algorithm called Adversarial Cheap Talk (ACT) to train Adversaries
  in this setting. We demonstrate that an Adversary trained with ACT can still significantly
  influence the Victim’s training and testing performance, despite the highly constrained
  setting. Affecting train-time performance reveals a new attack vector and provides
  insight into the success and failure modes of existing RL algorithms. More specifically,
  we show that an ACT Adversary is capable of harming performance by interfering with
  the learner’s function approximation, or instead helping the Victim’s performance
  by outputting useful features. Finally, we show that an ACT Adversary can manipulate
  messages during train-time to directly and arbitrarily control the Victim at test-time.
