title: Stochastic Gradient Descent-Induced Drift of Representation in a Two-Layer
  Neural Network
openreview: yqUhEFPoDN
abstract: Representational drift refers to over-time changes in neural activation
  accompanied by a stable task performance. Despite being observed in the brain and
  in artificial networks, the mechanisms of drift and its implications are not fully
  understood. Motivated by recent experimental findings of stimulus-dependent drift
  in the piriform cortex, we use theory and simulations to study this phenomenon in
  a two-layer linear feedforward network. Specifically, in a continual online learning
  scenario, we study the drift induced by the noise inherent in the Stochastic Gradient
  Descent (SGD). By decomposing the learning dynamics into the normal and tangent
  spaces of the minimum-loss manifold, we show the former corresponds to a finite
  variance fluctuation, while the latter could be considered as an effective diffusion
  process on the manifold. We analytically compute the fluctuation and the diffusion
  coefficients for the stimuli representations in the hidden layer as functions of
  network parameters and input distribution. Further, consistent with experiments,
  we show that the drift rate is slower for a more frequently presented stimulus.
  Overall, our analysis yields a theoretical framework for better understanding of
  the drift phenomenon in biological and artificial neural networks.
