title: 'Speed-Oblivious Online Scheduling: Knowing (Precise) Speeds is not Necessary'
openreview: 6LZNpFqDHB
abstract: 'We consider online scheduling on unrelated (heterogeneous) machines in
  a speed-oblivious setting, where an algorithm is unaware of the exact job-dependent
  processing speeds. We show strong impossibility results for clairvoyant and non-clairvoyant
  algorithms and overcome them in models inspired by practical settings: (i) we provide
  competitive learning-augmented algorithms, assuming that (possibly erroneous) predictions
  on the speeds are given, and (ii) we provide competitive algorithms for the speed-ordered
  model, where a single global order of machines according to their unknown job-dependent
  speeds is known. We prove strong theoretical guarantees and evaluate our findings
  on a representative heterogeneous multi-core processor. These seem to be the first
  empirical results for scheduling algorithms with predictions that are evaluated
  in a non-synthetic hardware environment.'
