title: 'NNSplitter: An Active Defense Solution for DNN Model via Automated Weight
  Obfuscation'
openreview: be9T7nuBNi
abstract: 'As a type of valuable intellectual property (IP), deep neural network (DNN)
  models have been protected by techniques like watermarking. However, such passive
  model protection cannot fully prevent model abuse. In this work, we propose an active
  model IP protection scheme, namely NNSplitter, which actively protects the model
  by splitting it into two parts: the obfuscated model that performs poorly due to
  weight obfuscation, and the model secrets consisting of the indexes and original
  values of the obfuscated weights, which can only be accessed by authorized users
  with the support of the trusted execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate
  the effectiveness of NNSplitter, e.g., by only modifying 275 out of over 11 million
  (i.e., 0.002%) weights, the accuracy of the obfuscated ResNet-18 model on CIFAR-10
  can drop to 10%. Moreover, NNSplitter is stealthy and resilient against norm clipping
  and fine-tuning attacks, making it an appealing solution for DNN model protection.
