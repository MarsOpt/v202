title: On the Within-Group Fairness of Screening Classifiers
openreview: Eni4D5gVBq
abstract: Screening classifiers are increasingly used to identify qualified candidates
  in a variety of selection processes. In this context, it has been recently shown
  that if a classifier is calibrated, one can identify the smallest set of candidates
  which contains, in expectation, a desired number of qualified candidates using a
  threshold decision rule. This lends support to focusing on calibration as the only
  requirement for screening classifiers. In this paper, we argue that screening policies
  that use calibrated classifiers may suffer from an understudied type of within-group
  unfairnessâ€”they may unfairly treat qualified members within demographic groups of
  interest. Further, we argue that this type of unfairness can be avoided if classifiers
  satisfy within-group monotonicity, a natural monotonicity property within each group.
  Then, we introduce an efficient post-processing algorithm based on dynamic programming
  to minimally modify a given calibrated classifier so that its probability estimates
  satisfy within-group monotonicity. We validate our algorithm using US Census survey
  data and show that within-group monotonicity can often be achieved at a small cost
  in terms of prediction granularity and shortlist size.
