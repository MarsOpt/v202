title: Towards credible visual model interpretation with path attribution
openreview: cHZBCZmfSo
abstract: With its inspirational roots in game-theory, path attribution framework
  stands out among the post-hoc model interpretation techniques due to its axiomatic
  nature. However, recent developments show that despite being axiomatic, path attribution
  methods can compute counter-intuitive feature attributions. Not only that, for deep
  visual models, the methods may also not conform to the original game-theoretic intuitions
  that are the basis of their axiomatic nature. To address these issues, we perform
  a systematic investigation of the path attribution framework. We first pinpoint
  the conditions in which the counter-intuitive attributions of deep visual models
  can be avoided under this framework. Then, we identify a mechanism of integrating
  the attributions over the paths such that they computationally conform to the original
  insights of game-theory. These insights are eventually combined into a method, which
  provides intuitive and reliable feature attributions. We also establish the findings
  empirically by evaluating the method on multiple datasets, models and evaluation
  metrics. Extensive experiments show a consistent quantitative and qualitative gain
  in the results over the baselines.
