title: Nonlinear Causal Discovery with Latent Confounders
openreview: WIvyzQAaPP
abstract: 'Causal discovery, the task of discovering the causal graph over a set of
  observed variables $X_1,\ldots,X_m$, is a challenging problem. One of the cornerstone
  assumptions is that of causal sufficiency: that <em>all</em> common causes of <em>all</em>
  measured variables have been observed. When it does not hold, causal discovery algorithms
  making this assumption return networks with many spurious edges. In this paper,
  we propose a nonlinear causal model involving hidden confounders. We show that it
  is identifiable from only the observed data and propose an efficient method for
  recovering this causal model. At the heart of our approach is a variational autoencoder
  which parametrizes both the causal interactions between observed variables as well
  as the influence of the unobserved confounders. Empirically we show that it outperforms
  other state-of-the-art methods for causal discovery under latent confounding on
  synthetic and real-world data.'
