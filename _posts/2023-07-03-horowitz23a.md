title: 'Causal Strategic Classification: A Tale of Two Shifts'
openreview: R3d0HoKznc
abstract: When users can benefit from certain predictive outcomes, they may be prone
  to act to achieve those outcome, e.g., by strategically modifying their features.
  The goal in strategic classification is therefore to train predictive models that
  are robust to such behavior. However, the conventional framework assumes that changing
  features does not change actual outcomes, which depicts users as "gaming" the system.
  Here we remove this assumption, and study learning in a causal strategic setting
  where true outcomes do change. Focusing on accuracy as our primary objective, we
  show how strategic behavior and causal effects underlie two complementing forms
  of distribution shift. We characterize these shifts, and propose a learning algorithm
  that balances between these two forces and over time, and permits end-to-end training.
  Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrate the utility of our
  approach.
