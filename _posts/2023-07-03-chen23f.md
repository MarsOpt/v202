title: Provably Convergent Schrödinger Bridge with Applications to Probabilistic Time
  Series Imputation
openreview: HRmSGZZ1FY
abstract: The Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP) is gaining increasing attention in
  generative modeling and showing promising potential even in comparison with the
  score-based generative models (SGMs). SBP can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized
  optimal transport problem, which conducts projections onto every other marginal
  alternatingly. However, in practice, only approximated projections are accessible
  and their convergence is not well understood. To fill this gap, we present a first
  convergence analysis of the Schrödinger bridge algorithm based on approximated projections.
  As for its practical applications, we apply SBP to probabilistic time series imputation
  by generating missing values conditioned on observed data. We show that optimizing
  the transport cost improves the performance and the proposed algorithm achieves
  the state-of-the-art result in healthcare and environmental data while exhibiting
  the advantage of exploring both temporal and feature patterns in probabilistic time
  series imputation.
