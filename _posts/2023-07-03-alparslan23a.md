title: Differentially Private Distributed Bayesian Linear Regression with MCMC
openreview: O3adXl7uBw
abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian inference framework for distributed differentially
  private linear regression. We consider a distributed setting where multiple parties
  hold parts of the data and share certain summary statistics of their portions in
  privacy-preserving noise. We develop a novel generative statistical model for privately
  shared statistics, which exploits a useful distributional relation between the summary
  statistics of linear regression. We propose Bayesian estimation of the regression
  coefficients, mainly using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, while we also provide
  a fast version that performs approximate Bayesian estimation in one iteration. The
  proposed methods have computational advantages over their competitors. We provide
  numerical results on both real and simulated data, which demonstrate that the proposed
  algorithms provide well-rounded estimation and prediction.
