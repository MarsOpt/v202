title: Thompson Sampling for High-Dimensional Sparse Linear Contextual Bandits
openreview: ZI4vN6D9Kk
abstract: We consider the stochastic linear contextual bandit problem with high-dimensional
  features. We analyze the Thompson sampling algorithm using special classes of sparsity-inducing
  priors (e.g., spike-and-slab) to model the unknown parameter and provide a nearly
  optimal upper bound on the expected cumulative regret. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first work that provides theoretical guarantees of Thompson sampling
  in high-dimensional and sparse contextual bandits. For faster computation, we use
  variational inference instead of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate
  the posterior distribution. Extensive simulations demonstrate the improved performance
  of our proposed algorithm over existing ones.
