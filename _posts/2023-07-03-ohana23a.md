title: Shedding a PAC-Bayesian Light on Adaptive Sliced-Wasserstein Distances
openreview: bKxkWVTrxx
abstract: 'The Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) is a computationally efficient and
  theoretically grounded alternative to the Wasserstein distance. Yet, the literature
  on its statistical properties – or, more accurately, its generalization properties
  – with respect to the distribution of slices, beyond the uniform measure, is scarce.
  To bring new contributions to this line of research, we leverage the PAC-Bayesian
  theory and a central observation that SW may be interpreted as an average risk,
  the quantity PAC-Bayesian bounds have been designed to characterize. We provide
  three types of results: i) PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that hold on what
  we refer as adaptive Sliced-Wasserstein distances, i.e. SW defined with respect
  to arbitrary distributions of slices (among which data-dependent distributions),
  ii) a principled procedure to learn the distribution of slices that yields maximally
  discriminative SW, by optimizing our theoretical bounds, and iii) empirical illustrations
  of our theoretical findings.'
