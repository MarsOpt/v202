title: Near-Optimal Algorithms for Private Online Optimization in the Realizable Regime
openreview: SjwWVAyYKh
abstract: We consider online learning problems in the realizable setting, where there
  is a zero-loss solution, and propose new Differentially Private (DP) algorithms
  that obtain near-optimal regret bounds. For the problem of online prediction from
  experts, we design new algorithms that obtain near-optimal regret $O \big( \varepsilon^{-1}
  \mathsf{poly}(\log{d}) \big)$ where $d$ is the number of experts. This significantly
  improves over the best existing regret bounds for the DP non-realizable setting
  which are $O \big( \varepsilon^{-1} \min\big\{d, \sqrt{T\log d}\big\} \big)$. We
  also develop an adaptive algorithm for the small-loss setting with regret $(L^\star+
  \varepsilon^{-1}) \cdot O(\mathsf{poly}(\log{d}))$ where $L^\star$ is the total
  loss of the best expert. Additionally, we consider DP online convex optimization
  in the realizable setting and propose an algorithm with near-optimal regret $O \big(\varepsilon^{-1}
  \mathsf{poly}(d) \big)$, as well as an algorithm for the smooth case with regret
  $O \big( (\sqrt{Td}/\varepsilon)^{2/3} \big)$, both significantly improving over
  existing bounds in the non-realizable regime.
