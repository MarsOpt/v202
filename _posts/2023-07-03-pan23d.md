title: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach based on the Hadamard Transform for the
  Convolutional Layer
openreview: bZTyDxBpx0
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Hadamard Transform (HT)-based neural network
  layer for hybrid quantum-classical computing. It implements the regular convolutional
  layers in the Hadamard transform domain. The idea is based on the HT convolution
  theorem which states that the dyadic convolution between two vectors is equivalent
  to the element-wise multiplication of their HT representation. Computing the HT
  is simply the application of a Hadamard gate to each qubit individually, so the
  HT computations of our proposed layer can be implemented on a quantum computer.
  Compared to the regular Conv2D layer, the proposed HT-perceptron layer is computationally
  more efficient. Compared to a CNN with the same number of trainable parameters and
  99.26% test accuracy, our HT network reaches 99.31% test accuracy with 57.1% MACs
  reduced in the MNIST dataset; and in our ImageNet-1K experiments, our HT-based ResNet-50
  exceeds the accuracy of the baseline ResNet-50 by 0.59% center-crop top-1 accuracy
  using 11.5% fewer parameters with 12.6% fewer MACs.
