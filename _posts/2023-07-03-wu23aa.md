title: Differentially Private Episodic Reinforcement Learning with Heavy-tailed Rewards
openreview: 24WcHqDM6O
abstract: In this paper we study the problem of (finite horizon tabular) Markov decision
  processes (MDPs) with heavy-tailed rewards under the constraint of differential
  privacy (DP). Compared with the previous studies for private reinforcement learning
  that typically assume rewards are sampled from some bounded or sub-Gaussian distributions
  to ensure DP, we consider the setting where reward distributions have only finite
  $(1+v)$-th moments with some $v \in (0,1]$. By resorting to robust mean estimators
  for rewards, we first propose two frameworks for heavy-tailed MDPs, i.e., one is
  for value iteration and another is for policy optimization. Under each framework,
  we consider both joint differential privacy (JDP) and local differential privacy
  (LDP) models. Based on our frameworks, we provide regret upper bounds for both JDP
  and LDP cases, and show that the moment of distributions and privacy budget have
  significant impact on regrets. Finally, we establish a lower bound of regret minimization
  for heavy-tailed MDPs in JDP model by reducing it to the instance-independent lower
  bound of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits in DP model. We also show the lower bound
  for the problem in LDP by adopting some private minimax methods. Our results reveal
  that there are fundamental differences between the problem of private RL with sub-Gaussian
  and that with heavy-tailed rewards.
