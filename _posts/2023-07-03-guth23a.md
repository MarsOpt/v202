title: Conditionally Strongly Log-Concave Generative Models
openreview: WHVHiOR3XQ
abstract: There is a growing gap between the impressive results of deep image generative
  models and classical algorithms that offer theoretical guarantees. The former suffer
  from mode collapse or memorization issues, limiting their application to scientific
  data. The latter require restrictive assumptions such as log-concavity to escape
  the curse of dimensionality. We partially bridge this gap by introducing conditionally
  strongly log-concave (CSLC) models, which factorize the data distribution into a
  product of conditional probability distributions that are strongly log-concave.
  This factorization is obtained with orthogonal projectors adapted to the data distribution.
  It leads to efficient parameter estimation and sampling algorithms, with theoretical
  guarantees, although the data distribution is not globally log-concave. We show
  that several challenging multiscale processes are conditionally log-concave using
  wavelet packet orthogonal projectors. Numerical results are shown for physical fields
  such as the $\varphi^4$ model and weak lensing convergence maps with higher resolution
  than in previous works.
