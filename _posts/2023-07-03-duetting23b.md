title: Optimal No-Regret Learning for One-Sided Lipschitz Functions
openreview: yv8GUQREda
abstract: Inspired by applications in pricing and contract design, we study the maximization
  of one-sided Lipschitz functions, which only provide the (weaker) guarantee that
  they do not grow too quickly in one direction. We show that it is possible to learn
  a maximizer for such a function while incurring $O(\log \log T)$ total regret (with
  a universal constant independent of the number of discontinuities / complexity of
  the function). This regret bound is asymptotically optimal in $T$ due to a lower
  bound of Kleinberg and Leighton. By applying this algorithm, we show that one can
  sell digital goods to multiple buyers and learn the optimal linear contract in the
  principal-agent setting while incurring at most $O(\log \log T)$ regret.
