title: 'Data-OOB: Out-of-bag Estimate as a Simple and Efficient Data Value'
openreview: MpSqLxVQ67
abstract: Data valuation is a powerful framework for providing statistical insights
  into which data are beneficial or detrimental to model training. Many Shapley-based
  data valuation methods have shown promising results in various downstream tasks,
  however, they are well known to be computationally challenging as it requires training
  a large number of models. As a result, it has been recognized as infeasible to apply
  to large datasets. To address this issue, we propose Data-OOB, a new data valuation
  method for a bagging model that utilizes the out-of-bag estimate. The proposed method
  is computationally efficient and can scale to millions of data by reusing trained
  weak learners. Specifically, Data-OOB takes less than $2.25$ hours on a single CPU
  processor when there are $10^6$ samples to evaluate and the input dimension is $100$.
  Furthermore, Data-OOB has solid theoretical interpretations in that it identifies
  the same important data point as the infinitesimal jackknife influence function
  when two different points are compared. We conduct comprehensive experiments using
  12 classification datasets, each with thousands of sample sizes. We demonstrate
  that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art data
  valuation methods in identifying mislabeled data and finding a set of helpful (or
  harmful) data points, highlighting the potential for applying data values in real-world
  applications.
