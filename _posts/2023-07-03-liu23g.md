title: Identifiability of Label Noise Transition Matrix
openreview: 8U4RNTGsIf
abstract: The noise transition matrix plays a central role in the problem of learning
  with noisy labels. Among many other reasons, a large number of existing solutions
  rely on the knowledge of it. Identifying and estimating the transition matrix without
  ground truth labels is a critical and challenging task. When label noise transition
  depends on each instance, the problem of identifying the instance-dependent noise
  transition matrix becomes substantially more challenging. Despite recently proposed
  solutions for learning from instance-dependent noisy labels, the literature lacks
  a unified understanding of when such a problem remains identifiable. The goal of
  this paper is to characterize the identifiability of the label noise transition
  matrix. Building on Kruskalâ€™s identifiability results, we are able to show the necessity
  of multiple noisy labels in identifying the noise transition matrix at the instance
  level. We further instantiate the results to explain the successes of the state-of-the-art
  solutions and how additional assumptions alleviated the requirement of multiple
  noisy labels. Our result reveals that disentangled features improve identification.
  This discovery led us to an approach that improves the estimation of the transition
  matrix using properly disentangled features. Code is available at https://github.com/UCSC-REAL/Identifiability.
