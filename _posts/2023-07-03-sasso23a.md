title: Posterior Sampling for Deep Reinforcement Learning
openreview: ZwjSECgl6p
abstract: 'Despite remarkable successes, deep reinforcement learning algorithms remain
  sample inefficient: they require an enormous amount of trial and error to find good
  policies. Model-based algorithms promise sample efficiency by building an environment
  model that can be used for planning. Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning
  is such a model-based algorithm that has attracted significant interest due to its
  performance in the tabular setting. This paper introduces Posterior Sampling for
  Deep Reinforcement Learning (PSDRL), the first truly scalable approximation of Posterior
  Sampling for Reinforcement Learning that retains its model-based essence. PSDRL
  combines efficient uncertainty quantification over latent state space models with
  a specially tailored incremental planning algorithm based on value-function approximation.
  Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that PSDRL significantly outperforms
  previous state-of-the-art attempts at scaling up posterior sampling while being
  competitive with a state-of-the-art (model-based) reinforcement learning method,
  both in sample efficiency and computational efficiency.'
