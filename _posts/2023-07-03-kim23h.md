title: 'DevFormer: A Symmetric Transformer for Context-Aware Device Placement'
openreview: pWk5MoS04I
abstract: In this paper, we present DevFormer, a novel transformer-based architecture
  for addressing the complex and computationally demanding problem of hardware design
  optimization. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of transformers in domains including
  natural language processing and computer vision, their use in hardware design has
  been limited by the scarcity of offline data. Our approach addresses this limitation
  by introducing strong inductive biases such as relative positional embeddings and
  action-permutation symmetricity that effectively capture the hardware context and
  enable efficient design optimization with limited offline data. We apply DevFormer
  to the problem of decoupling capacitor placement and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods in both simulated and real hardware, leading to improved performances while
  reducing the number of components by more than 30%. Finally, we show that our approach
  achieves promising results in other offline contextual learning-based combinatorial
  optimization tasks.
