title: 'Effective Minkowski Dimension of Deep Nonparametric Regression: Function Approximation
  and Statistical Theories'
openreview: CeZGwmsIIz
abstract: Existing theories on deep nonparametric regression have shown that when
  the input data lie on a low-dimensional manifold, deep neural networks can adapt
  to the intrinsic data structures. In real world applications, such an assumption
  of data lying exactly on a low dimensional manifold is stringent. This paper introduces
  a relaxed assumption that the input data are concentrated around a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$
  denoted by $\mathcal{S}$, and the intrinsic dimension of $\mathcal{S}$ can be characterized
  by a new complexity notation â€“ effective Minkowski dimension. We prove that, the
  sample complexity of deep nonparametric regression only depends on the effective
  Minkowski dimension of $\mathcal{S}$ denoted by $p$. We further illustrate our theoretical
  findings by considering nonparametric regression with an anisotropic Gaussian random
  design $N(0,\Sigma)$, where $\Sigma$ is full rank. When the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$
  have an exponential or polynomial decay, the effective Minkowski dimension of such
  an Gaussian random design is $p=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$ or $p=\mathcal{O}(n^\gamma)$,
  respectively, where $n$ is the sample size and $\gamma\in(0,1)$ is a small constant
  depending on the polynomial decay rate. Our theory shows that, when the manifold
  assumption does not hold, deep neural networks can still adapt to the effective
  Minkowski dimension of the data, and circumvent the curse of the ambient dimensionality
  for moderate sample sizes.
