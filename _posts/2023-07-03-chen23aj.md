title: Efficient Personalized Federated Learning via Sparse Model-Adaptation
openreview: ieSN7Xyo8g
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train machine learning models for multiple
  clients without sharing their own private data. Due to the heterogeneity of clients’
  local data distribution, recent studies explore the personalized FL that learns
  and deploys distinct local models with the help of auxiliary global models. However,
  the clients can be heterogeneous in terms of not only local data distribution, but
  also their computation and communication resources. The capacity and efficiency
  of personalized models are restricted by the lowest-resource clients, leading to
  sub-optimal performance and limited practicality of personalized FL. To overcome
  these challenges, we propose a novel approach named pFedGate for efficient personalized
  FL by adaptively and efficiently learning sparse local models. With a lightweight
  trainable gating layer, pFedGate enables clients to reach their full potential in
  model capacity by generating different sparse models accounting for both the heterogeneous
  data distributions and resource constraints. Meanwhile, the computation and communication
  efficiency are both improved thanks to the adaptability between the model sparsity
  and clients’ resources. Further, we theoretically show that the proposed pFedGate
  has superior complexity with guaranteed convergence and generalization error. Extensive
  experiments show that pFedGate achieves superior global accuracy, individual accuracy
  and efficiency simultaneously over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate
  that pFedGate performs better than competitors in the novel clients participation
  and partial clients participation scenarios, and can learn meaningful sparse local
  models adapted to different data distributions.
