title: Likelihood Adjusted Semidefinite Programs for Clustering Heterogeneous Data
openreview: aOqkfUCbVl
abstract: Clustering is a widely deployed unsupervised learning tool. Model-based
  clustering is a flexible framework to tackle data heterogeneity when the clusters
  have different shapes. Likelihood-based inference for mixture distributions often
  involves non-convex and high-dimensional objective functions, imposing difficult
  computational and statistical challenges. The classic expectation-maximization (EM)
  algorithm is a computationally thrifty iterative method that maximizes a surrogate
  function minorizing the log-likelihood of observed data in each iteration, which
  however suffers from bad local maxima even in the special case of the standard Gaussian
  mixture model with common isotropic covariance matrices. On the other hand, recent
  studies reveal that the unique global solution of a semidefinite programming (SDP)
  relaxed $K$-means achieves the information-theoretically sharp threshold for perfectly
  recovering the cluster labels under the standard Gaussian mixture model. In this
  paper, we extend the SDP approach to a general setting by integrating cluster labels
  as model parameters and propose an iterative likelihood adjusted SDP (iLA-SDP) method
  that directly maximizes the exact observed likelihood in the presence of data heterogeneity.
  By lifting the cluster assignment to group-specific membership matrices, iLA-SDP
  avoids centroids estimation â€“ a key feature that allows exact recovery under well-separateness
  of centroids without being trapped by their adversarial configurations. Thus iLA-SDP
  is less sensitive than EM to initialization and more stable on high-dimensional
  data. Our numeric experiments demonstrate that iLA-SDP can achieve lower mis-clustering
  errors over several widely used clustering methods including $K$-means, SDP and
  EM algorithms.
