title: Wrapped Cauchy Distributed Angular Softmax for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition
openreview: VorD7k3Ldh
abstract: Addressing imbalanced or long-tailed data is a major challenge in visual
  recognition tasks due to disparities between training and testing distributions
  and issues with data noise. We propose the Wrapped Cauchy Distributed Angular Softmax
  (WCDAS), a novel softmax function that incorporates data-wise Gaussian-based kernels
  into the angular correlation between feature representations and classifier weights,
  effectively mitigating noise and sparse sampling concerns. The class-wise distribution
  of angular representation becomes a sum of these kernels. Our theoretical analysis
  reveals that the wrapped Cauchy distribution excels the Gaussian distribution in
  approximating mixed distributions. Additionally, WCDAS uses trainable concentration
  parameters to dynamically adjust the compactness and margin of each class. Empirical
  results confirm label-aware behavior in these parameters and demonstrate WCDASâ€™s
  superiority over other state-of-the-art softmax-based methods in handling long-tailed
  visual recognition across multiple benchmark datasets. The code is public available.
