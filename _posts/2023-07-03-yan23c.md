title: Distortion and Uncertainty Aware Loss for Panoramic Depth Completion
openreview: 0tLjOxqjLS
abstract: Standard MSE or MAE loss function is commonly used in limited field-of-vision
  depth completion, treating each pixel equally under a basic assumption that all
  pixels have same contribution during optimization. Recently, with the rapid rise
  of panoramic photography, panoramic depth completion (PDC) has raised increasing
  attention in 3D computer vision. However, the assumption is inapplicable to panoramic
  data due to its latitude-wise distortion and high uncertainty nearby textures and
  edges. To handle these challenges, we propose distortion and uncertainty aware loss
  (DUL) that consists of a distortion-aware loss and an uncertainty-aware loss. The
  distortion-aware loss is designed to tackle the panoramic distortion caused by equirectangular
  projection, whose coordinate transformation relation is used to adaptively calculate
  the weight of the latitude-wise distortion, distributing uneven importance instead
  of the equal treatment for each pixel. The uncertainty-aware loss is presented to
  handle the inaccuracy in non-smooth regions. Specifically, we characterize uncertainty
  into PDC solutions under Bayesian deep learning framework, where a novel consistent
  uncertainty estimation constraint is designed to learn the consistency between multiple
  uncertainty maps of a single panorama. This consistency constraint allows model
  to produce more precise uncertainty estimation that is robust to feature deformation.
  Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method over standard loss functions,
  reaching the state of the art.
