title: Towards Coherent Image Inpainting Using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
openreview: 17YbAlc1tW
abstract: Image inpainting refers to the task of generating a complete, natural image
  based on a partially revealed reference image. Recently, many research interests
  have been focused on addressing this problem using fixed diffusion models. These
  approaches typically directly replace the revealed region of the intermediate or
  final generated images with that of the reference image or its variants. However,
  since the unrevealed regions are not directly modified to match the context, it
  results in incoherence between revealed and unrevealed regions. To address the incoherence
  problem, a small number of methods introduce a rigorous Bayesian framework, but
  they tend to introduce mismatches between the generated and the reference images
  due to the approximation errors in computing the posterior distributions. In this
  paper, we propose CoPaint, which can coherently inpaint the whole image without
  introducing mismatches. CoPaint also uses the Bayesian framework to jointly modify
  both revealed and unrevealed regions but approximates the posterior distribution
  in a way that allows the errors to gradually drop to zero throughout the denoising
  steps, thus strongly penalizing any mismatches with the reference image. Our experiments
  verify that CoPaint can outperform the existing diffusion-based methods under both
  objective and subjective metrics.
