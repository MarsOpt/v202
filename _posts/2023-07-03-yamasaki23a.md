title: 'Quantum Ridgelet Transform: Winning Lottery Ticket of Neural Networks with
  Quantum Computation'
openreview: ppTpHSw0kj
abstract: A significant challenge in the field of quantum machine learning (QML) is
  to establish applications of quantum computation to accelerate common tasks in machine
  learning such as those for neural networks. Ridgelet transform has been a fundamental
  mathematical tool in the theoretical studies of neural networks, but the practical
  applicability of ridgelet transform to conducting learning tasks was limited since
  its numerical implementation by conventional classical computation requires an exponential
  runtime $\exp(O(D))$ as data dimension $D$ increases. To address this problem, we
  develop a quantum ridgelet transform (QRT), which implements the ridgelet transform
  of a quantum state within a linear runtime $O(D)$ of quantum computation. As an
  application, we also show that one can use QRT as a fundamental subroutine for QML
  to efficiently find a sparse trainable subnetwork of large shallow wide neural networks
  without conducting large-scale optimization of the original network. This application
  discovers an efficient way in this regime to demonstrate the lottery ticket hypothesis
  on finding such a sparse trainable neural network. These results open an avenue
  of QML for accelerating learning tasks with commonly used classical neural networks.
