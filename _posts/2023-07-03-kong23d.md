title: Covariate balancing using the integral probability metric for causal inference
openreview: X7UCNsajh9
abstract: Weighting methods in causal inference have been widely used to achieve a
  desirable level of covariate balancing. However, the existing weighting methods
  have desirable theoretical properties only when a certain model, either the propensity
  score or outcome regression model, is correctly specified. In addition, the corresponding
  estimators do not behave well for finite samples due to large variance even when
  the model is correctly specified. In this paper, we consider to use the integral
  probability metric (IPM), which is a metric between two probability measures, for
  covariate balancing. Optimal weights are determined so that weighted empirical distributions
  for the treated and control groups have the smallest IPM value for a given set of
  discriminators. We prove that the corresponding estimator can be consistent without
  correctly specifying any model (neither the propensity score nor the outcome regression
  model). In addition, we empirically show that our proposed method outperforms existing
  weighting methods with large margins for finite samples.
