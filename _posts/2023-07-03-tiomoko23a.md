title: 'PCA-based Multi-Task Learning: a Random Matrix Approach'
openreview: prMTSnjVuR
abstract: The article proposes and theoretically analyses a <em>computationally efficient</em>
  multi-task learning (MTL) extension of popular principal component analysis (PCA)-based
  supervised learning schemes. The analysis reveals that (i) by default, learning
  may dramatically fail by suffering from <em>negative transfer</em>, but that (ii)
  simple counter-measures on data labels avert negative transfer and necessarily result
  in improved performances. Supporting experiments on synthetic and real data benchmarks
  show that the proposed method achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art
  MTL methods but at a <em>significantly reduced computational cost</em>.
