title: Preprocessors Matter! Realistic Decision-Based Attacks on Machine Learning
  Systems
openreview: ho3AhQgQ5o
abstract: Decision-based attacks construct adversarial examples against a machine
  learning (ML) model by making only hard-label queries. These attacks have mainly
  been applied directly to standalone neural networks. However, in practice, ML models
  are just one component of a larger learning system. We find that by adding a single
  preprocessor in front of a classifier, state-of-the-art query-based attacks are
  up to seven× less effective at attacking a prediction pipeline than at attacking
  the model alone. We explain this discrepancy by the fact that most preprocessors
  introduce some notion of invariance to the input space. Hence, attacks that are
  unaware of this invariance inevitably waste a large number of queries to re-discover
  or overcome it. We, therefore, develop techniques to (i) reverse-engineer the preprocessor
  and then (ii) use this extracted information to attack the end-to-end system. Our
  preprocessors extraction method requires only a few hundred queries, and our preprocessor-aware
  attacks recover the same efficacy as when attacking the model alone. The code can
  be found at https://github.com/google-research/preprocessor-aware-black-box-attack.
