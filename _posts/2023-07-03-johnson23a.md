title: R-U-SURE? Uncertainty-Aware Code Suggestions By Maximizing Utility Across Random
  User Intents
openreview: pRki7DdoJQ
abstract: Large language models show impressive results at predicting structured text
  such as code, but also commonly introduce errors and hallucinations in their output.
  When used to assist software developers, these models may make mistakes that users
  must go back and fix, or worse, introduce subtle bugs that users may miss entirely.
  We propose <em>Randomized Utility-driven Synthesis of Uncertain REgions (R-U-SURE)</em>,
  an approach for building uncertainty-aware suggestions based on a decision-theoretic
  model of goal-conditioned utility, using random samples from a generative model
  as a proxy for the unobserved possible intents of the end user. Our technique combines
  minimum-Bayes-risk decoding, dual decomposition, and decision diagrams in order
  to efficiently produce structured uncertainty summaries, given only sample access
  to an arbitrary generative model of code and an optional AST parser. We demonstrate
  R-U-SURE on three developer-assistance tasks, and show that it can be applied different
  user interaction patterns without retraining the model and leads to more accurate
  uncertainty estimates than token-probability baselines. We also release our implementation
  as an open-source library at https://github.com/google-research/r_u_sure.
