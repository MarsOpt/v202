title: Self-Attention Amortized Distributional Projection Optimization for Sliced
  Wasserstein Point-Cloud Reconstruction
openreview: 6s64XSlhJC
abstract: Max sliced Wasserstein (Max-SW) distance has been widely known as a solution
  for less discriminative projections of sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. In applications
  that have various independent pairs of probability measures, amortized projection
  optimization is utilized to predict the â€œmax" projecting directions given two input
  measures instead of using projected gradient ascent multiple times. Despite being
  efficient, Max-SW and its amortized version cannot guarantee metricity property
  due to the sub-optimality of the projected gradient ascent and the amortization
  gap. Therefore, we propose to replace Max-SW with distributional sliced Wasserstein
  distance with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) projecting distribution (v-DSW). Since v-DSW
  is a metric with any non-degenerate vMF distribution, its amortized version can
  guarantee the metricity when performing amortization. Furthermore, current amortized
  models are not permutation invariant and symmetric. To address the issue, we design
  amortized models based on self-attention architecture. In particular, we adopt efficient
  self-attention architectures to make the computation linear in the number of supports.
  With the two improvements, we derive self-attention amortized distributional projection
  optimization and show its appealing performance in point-cloud reconstruction and
  its downstream applications
