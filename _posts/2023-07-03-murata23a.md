title: 'GibbsDDRM: A Partially Collapsed Gibbs Sampler for Solving Blind Inverse Problems
  with Denoising Diffusion Restoration'
openreview: 4weSHLFgtZ
abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have been successfully used as priors in a
  variety of linear inverse problems, where the goal is to reconstruct a signal from
  noisy linear measurements. However, existing approaches require knowledge of the
  linear operator. In this paper, we propose GibbsDDRM, an extension of Denoising
  Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) to a blind setting in which the linear measurement
  operator is unknown. GibbsDDRM constructs a joint distribution of the data, measurements,
  and linear operator by using a pre-trained diffusion model for the data prior, and
  it solves the problem by posterior sampling with an efficient variant of a Gibbs
  sampler. The proposed method is problem-agnostic, meaning that a pre-trained diffusion
  model can be applied to various inverse problems without fine-tuning. In experiments,
  it achieved high performance on both blind image deblurring and vocal dereverberation
  tasks, despite the use of simple generic priors for the underlying linear operators.
