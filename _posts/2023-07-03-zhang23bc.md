title: Robust Situational Reinforcement Learning in Face of Context Disturbances
openreview: hGJLN2Ys4c
abstract: In many real-world tasks, some parts of state features, called contexts,
  are independent of action signals, e.g., customer demand in inventory control, speed
  of lead car in autonomous driving, etc. One of the challenges of reinforcement learning
  in these applications is that the true context transitions can be easily exposed
  some unknown source of contamination, leading to a shift of context transitions
  between source domains and target domains, which could cause performance degradation
  for RL algorithms. However, existing methods on robust RL aim at learning robust
  policies against the deviations of the entire system dynamics. To tackle this problem,
  this paper proposes the framework of robust situational Markov decision process
  (RS-MDP) which captures the possible deviations of context transitions explicitly.
  To scale to large context space, we introduce the softmin smoothed robust Bellman
  operator to learn the robust Q-value approximately, and apply our RS-MDP framework
  to existing RL algorithm SAC to learn the desired robust policies. We conduct experiments
  on several robot control tasks with dynamic contexts and inventory control tasks
  to demonstrate that our algorithm can generalize better and more robust against
  deviations of context transitions, and outperform existing robust RL algorithms.
