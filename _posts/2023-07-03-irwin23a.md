title: 'Neural Network Accelerated Implicit Filtering: Integrating Neural Network
  Surrogates With Provably Convergent Derivative Free Optimization Methods'
openreview: KG1eLtsX61
abstract: In this paper, we introduce neural network accelerated implicit filtering
  (NNAIF), a novel family of methods for solving noisy derivative free (i.e. black
  box, zeroth order) optimization problems. NNAIF intelligently combines the established
  literature on implicit filtering (IF) optimization methods with a neural network
  (NN) surrogate model of the objective function, resulting in accelerated derivative
  free methods for unconstrained optimization problems. The NN surrogate model consists
  of a fixed number of parameters, which can be as few as $\approx 1.3 \times 10^{4}$,
  that are updated as NNAIF progresses. We show that NNAIF directly inherits the convergence
  properties of IF optimization methods, and thus NNAIF is guaranteed to converge
  towards a critical point of the objective function under appropriate assumptions.
  Numerical experiments with $31$ noisy problems from the CUTEst optimization benchmark
  set demonstrate the benefits and costs associated with NNAIF. These benefits include
  NNAIFâ€™s ability to minimize structured functions of several thousand variables much
  more rapidly than well-known alternatives, such as Covariance Matrix Adaptation
  Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and finite difference based variants of gradient descent
  (GD) and BFGS, as well as its namesake IF.
