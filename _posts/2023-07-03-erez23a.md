title: Regret Minimization and Convergence to Equilibria in General-sum Markov Games
openreview: ILMHlUn4k6
abstract: An abundance of recent impossibility results establish that regret minimization
  in Markov games with adversarial opponents is both statistically and computationally
  intractable. Nevertheless, none of these results preclude the possibility of regret
  minimization under the assumption that all parties adopt the same learning procedure.
  In this work, we present the first (to our knowledge) algorithm for learning in
  general-sum Markov games that provides sublinear regret guarantees when executed
  by all agents. The bounds we obtain are for $\textit{swap regret}$, and thus, along
  the way, imply convergence to a $\textit{correlated}$ equilibrium. Our algorithm
  is decentralized, computationally efficient, and does not require any communication
  between agents. Our key observation is that online learning via policy optimization
  in Markov games essentially reduces to a form of $\textit{weighted}$ regret minimization,
  with $\textit{unknown}$ weights determined by the path length of the agentsâ€™ policy
  sequence. Consequently, controlling the path length leads to weighted regret objectives
  for which sufficiently adaptive algorithms provide sublinear regret guarantees.
