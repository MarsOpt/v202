title: Unveiling the Latent Space Geometry of Push-Forward Generative Models
openreview: qNxQusKPR0
abstract: Many deep generative models are defined as a push-forward of a Gaussian
  measure by a continuous generator, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  or Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). This work explores the latent space of such
  deep generative models. A key issue with these models is their tendency to output
  samples outside of the support of the target distribution when learning disconnected
  distributions. We investigate the relationship between the performance of these
  models and the geometry of their latent space. Building on recent developments in
  geometric measure theory, we prove a sufficient condition for optimality in the
  case where the dimension of the latent space is larger than the number of modes.
  Through experiments on GANs, we demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results
  and gain new insights into the latent space geometry of these models. Additionally,
  we propose a truncation method that enforces a simplicial cluster structure in the
  latent space and improves the performance of GANs.
