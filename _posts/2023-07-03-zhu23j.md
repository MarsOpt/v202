title: 'LeadFL: Client Self-Defense against Model Poisoning in Federated Learning'
openreview: 2CiaH2Tq4G
abstract: Federated Learning is highly susceptible to backdoor and targeted attacks
  as participants can manipulate their data and models locally without any oversight
  on whether they follow the correct process. There are a number of server-side defenses
  that mitigate the attacks by modifying or rejecting local updates submitted by clients.
  However, we find that bursty adversarial patterns with a high variance in the number
  of malicious clients can circumvent the existing defenses. We propose a client-self
  defense, LeadFL, that is combined with existing server-side defenses to thwart backdoor
  and targeted attacks. The core idea of LeadFL is a novel regularization term in
  local model training such that the Hessian matrix of local gradients is nullified.
  We provide the convergence analysis of LeadFL and its robustness guarantee in terms
  of certified radius. Our empirical evaluation shows that LeadFL is able to mitigate
  bursty adversarial patterns for both iid and non-iid data distributions. It frequently
  reduces the backdoor accuracy from more than 75% for state-of-the-art defenses to
  less than 10% while its impact on the main task accuracy is always less than for
  other client-side defenses.
