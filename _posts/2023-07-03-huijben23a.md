title: 'SOM-CPC: Unsupervised Contrastive Learning with Self-Organizing Maps for Structured
  Representations of High-Rate Time Series'
openreview: 79icaL3Wan
abstract: Continuous monitoring with an ever-increasing number of sensors has become
  ubiquitous across many application domains. However, acquired time series are typically
  high-dimensional and difficult to interpret. Expressive deep learning (DL) models
  have gained popularity for dimensionality reduction, but the resulting latent space
  often remains difficult to interpret. In this work we propose SOM-CPC, a model that
  visualizes data in an organized 2D manifold, while preserving higher-dimensional
  information. We address a largely unexplored and challenging set of scenarios comprising
  high-rate time series, and show on both synthetic and real-life data (physiological
  data and audio recordings) that SOM-CPC outperforms strong baselines like DL-based
  feature extraction, followed by conventional dimensionality reduction techniques,
  and models that jointly optimize a DL model and a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). SOM-CPC
  has great potential to acquire a better understanding of latent patterns in high-rate
  data streams.
