title: Learning Dense Correspondences between Photos and Sketches
openreview: LYBXqE1wfl
abstract: 'Humans effortlessly grasp the connection between sketches and real-world
  objects, even when these sketches are far from realistic. Moreover, human sketch
  understanding goes beyond categorization â€“ critically, it also entails understanding
  how individual elements within a sketch correspond to parts of the physical world
  it represents. What are the computational ingredients needed to support this ability?
  Towards answering this question, we make two contributions: first, we introduce
  a new sketch-photo correspondence benchmark, PSC6k, containing 150K annotations
  of 6250 sketch-photo pairs across 125 object categories, augmenting the existing
  Sketchy dataset with fine-grained correspondence metadata. Second, we propose a
  self-supervised method for learning dense correspondences between sketch-photo pairs,
  building upon recent advances in correspondence learning for pairs of photos. Our
  model uses a spatial transformer network to estimate the warp flow between latent
  representations of a sketch and photo extracted by a contrastive learning-based
  ConvNet backbone. We found that this approach outperformed several strong baselines
  and produced predictions that were quantitatively consistent with other warp-based
  methods. However, our benchmark also revealed systematic differences between predictions
  of the suite of models we tested and those of humans. Taken together, our work suggests
  a promising path towards developing artificial systems that achieve more human-like
  understanding of visual images at different levels of abstraction. Project page:
