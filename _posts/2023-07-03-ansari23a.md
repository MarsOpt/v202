title: Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Models for Irregularly-Sampled Time
  Series
openreview: GTos8jbYUa
abstract: Learning accurate predictive models of real-world dynamic phenomena (e.g.,
  climate, biological) remains a challenging task. One key issue is that the data
  generated by both natural and artificial processes often comprise time series that
  are irregularly sampled and/or contain missing observations. In this work, we propose
  the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling
  of time series through discrete-time observations. NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables
  to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only
  for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering
  theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic
  states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an
  efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference.
  Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved
  imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models.
