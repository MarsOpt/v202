title: Proper Scoring Rules for Survival Analysis
openreview: DUGrwP6gfC
abstract: Survival analysis is the problem of estimating probability distributions
  for future event times, which can be seen as a problem in uncertainty quantification.
  Although there are fundamental theories on strictly proper scoring rules for uncertainty
  quantification, little is known about those for survival analysis. In this paper,
  we investigate extensions of four major strictly proper scoring rules for survival
  analysis and we prove that these extensions are proper under certain conditions,
  which arise from the discretization of the estimation of probability distributions.
  We also compare the estimation performances of these extended scoring rules by using
  real datasets, and the extensions of the logarithmic score and the Brier score performed
  the best.
