title: A New PHO-rmula for Improved Performance of Semi-Structured Networks
openreview: pkzQcry2G8
abstract: Recent advances to combine structured regression models and deep neural
  networks for better interpretability, more expressiveness, and statistically valid
  uncertainty quantification demonstrate the versatility of semi-structured neural
  networks (SSNs). We show that techniques to properly identify the contributions
  of the different model components in SSNs, however, lead to suboptimal network estimation,
  slower convergence, and degenerated or erroneous predictions. In order to solve
  these problems while preserving favorable model properties, we propose a non-invasive
  post-hoc orthogonalization (PHO) that guarantees identifiability of model components
  and provides better estimation and prediction quality. Our theoretical findings
  are supported by numerical experiments, a benchmark comparison as well as a real-world
  application to COVID-19 infections.
