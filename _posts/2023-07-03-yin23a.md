title: 'CoCo: A Coupled Contrastive Framework for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Graph
  Classification'
openreview: IIqhdgLUio
abstract: Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive achievements
  in graph classification, they often need abundant task-specific labels, which could
  be extensively costly to acquire. A credible solution is to explore additional labeled
  graphs to enhance unsupervised learning on the target domain. However, how to apply
  GNNs to domain adaptation remains unsolved owing to the insufficient exploration
  of graph topology and the significant domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose
  Coupled Contrastive Graph Representation Learning (CoCo), which extracts the topological
  information from coupled learning branches and reduces the domain discrepancy with
  coupled contrastive learning. CoCo contains a graph convolutional network branch
  and a hierarchical graph kernel network branch, which explore graph topology in
  implicit and explicit manners. Besides, we incorporate coupled branches into a holistic
  multi-view contrastive learning framework, which not only incorporates graph representations
  learned from complementary views for enhanced understanding, but also encourages
  the similarity between cross-domain example pairs with the same semantics for domain
  alignment. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that our CoCo outperforms
  these competing baselines in different settings generally.
