title: Towards Practical Preferential Bayesian Optimization with Skew Gaussian Processes
openreview: ue4OeIMU29
abstract: We study preferential Bayesian optimization (BO) where reliable feedback
  is limited to pairwise comparison called duels. An important challenge in preferential
  BO, which uses the preferential Gaussian process (GP) model to represent flexible
  preference structure, is that the posterior distribution is a computationally intractable
  skew GP. The most widely used approach for preferential BO is Gaussian approximation,
  which ignores the skewness of the true posterior. Alternatively, Markov chain Monte
  Carlo (MCMC) based preferential BO is also proposed. In this work, we first verify
  the accuracy of Gaussian approximation, from which we reveal the critical problem
  that the predictive probability of duels can be inaccurate. This observation motivates
  us to improve the MCMC-based estimation for skew GP, for which we show the practical
  efficiency of Gibbs sampling and derive the low variance MC estimator. However,
  the computational time of MCMC can still be a bottleneck in practice. Towards building
  a more practical preferential BO, we develop a new method that achieves both high
  computational efficiency and low sample complexity, and then demonstrate its effectiveness
  through extensive numerical experiments.
