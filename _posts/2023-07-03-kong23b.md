title: Autoregressive Diffusion Model for Graph Generation
openreview: dtg76BRYCG
abstract: Diffusion-based graph generative models have recently obtained promising
  results for graph generation. However, existing diffusion-based graph generative
  models are mostly one-shot generative models that apply Gaussian diffusion in the
  dequantized adjacency matrix space. Such a strategy can suffer from difficulty in
  model training, slow sampling speed, and incapability of incorporating constraints.
  We propose an <em>autoregressive diffusion</em> model for graph generation. Unlike
  existing methods, we define a node-absorbing diffusion process that operates directly
  in the discrete graph space. For forward diffusion, we design a <em>diffusion ordering
  network</em>, which learns a data-dependent node absorbing ordering from graph topology.
  For reverse generation, we design a <em>denoising network</em> that uses the reverse
  node ordering to efficiently reconstruct the graph by predicting the node type of
  the new node and its edges with previously denoised nodes at a time. Based on the
  permutation invariance of graph, we show that the two networks can be jointly trained
  by optimizing a simple lower bound of data likelihood. Our experiments on six diverse
  generic graph datasets and two molecule datasets show that our model achieves better
  or comparable generation performance with previous state-of-the-art, and meanwhile
  enjoys fast generation speed.
