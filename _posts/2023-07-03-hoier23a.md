title: 'Dual Propagation: Accelerating Contrastive Hebbian Learning with Dyadic Neurons'
openreview: Clr1z6sIKP
abstract: Activity difference based learning algorithms—such as contrastive Hebbian
  learning and equilibrium propagation—have been proposed as biologically plausible
  alternatives to error back-propagation. However, on traditional digital chips these
  algorithms suffer from having to solve a costly inference problem twice, making
  these approaches more than two orders of magnitude slower than back-propagation.
  In the analog realm equilibrium propagation may be promising for fast and energy
  efficient learning, but states still need to be inferred and stored twice. Inspired
  by lifted neural networks and compartmental neuron models we propose a simple energy
  based compartmental neuron model, termed dual propagation, in which each neuron
  is a dyad with two intrinsic states. At inference time these intrinsic states encode
  the error/activity duality through their difference and their mean respectively.
  The advantage of this method is that only a single inference phase is needed and
  that inference can be solved in layerwise closed-form. Experimentally we show on
  common computer vision datasets, including Imagenet32x32, that dual propagation
  performs equivalently to back-propagation both in terms of accuracy and runtime.
