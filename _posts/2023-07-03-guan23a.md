title: 'DecompDiff: Diffusion Models with Decomposed Priors for Structure-Based Drug
  Design'
openreview: 9qy9DizMlr
abstract: Designing 3D ligands within a target binding site is a fundamental task
  in drug discovery. Existing structured-based drug design methods treat all ligand
  atoms equally, which ignores different roles of atoms in the ligand for drug design
  and can be less efficient for exploring the large drug-like molecule space. In this
  paper, inspired by the convention in pharmaceutical practice, we decompose the ligand
  molecule into two parts, namely arms and scaffold, and propose a new diffusion model,
  DecompDiff, with decomposed priors over arms and scaffold. In order to facilitate
  the decomposed generation and improve the properties of the generated molecules,
  we incorporate both bond diffusion in the model and additional validity guidance
  in the sampling phase. Extensive experiments on CrossDocked2020 show that our approach
  achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity molecules while
  maintaining proper molecular properties and conformational stability, with up to
  $-8.39$ Avg. Vina Dock score and $24.5%$ Success Rate. The code is provided at https://github.com/bytedance/DecompDiff
