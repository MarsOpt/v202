title: A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Biological Sequences
openreview: 8LdBTjylEw
abstract: Generative models of biological sequences are a powerful tool for learning
  from complex sequence data, predicting the effects of mutations, and designing novel
  biomolecules with desired properties. To evaluate generative models it is important
  to accurately measure differences between high-dimensional distributions. In this
  paper we propose the “KSD-B”, a novel divergence measure for distributions over
  biological sequences that is based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD). The
  KSD-B can be evaluated even when the normalizing constant of the model is unknown;
  it allows for variable length sequences and can take into account biological notions
  of sequence distance. Unlike previous KSDs over discrete spaces the KSD-B (a) is
  theoretically guaranteed to detect convergence and non-convergence of distributions
  over sequence space and (b) can be efficiently estimated in practice. We demonstrate
  the advantages of the KSD-B on problems with synthetic and real data, and apply
  it to measure the fit of state-of-the-art machine learning models. Overall, the
  KSD-B enables rigorous evaluation of generative biological sequence models, allowing
  the accuracy of models, sampling procedures, and library designs to be checked reliably.
