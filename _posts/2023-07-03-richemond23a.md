title: 'The Edge of Orthogonality: A Simple View of What Makes BYOL Tick'
openreview: GuVJ0hoHOl
abstract: Self-predictive unsupervised learning methods such as BYOL or SimSIAM have
  shown impressive results, and counter-intuitively, do not collapse to trivial representations.
  In this work, we aim at exploring the simplest possible mathematical arguments towards
  explaining the underlying mechanisms behind self-predictive unsupervised learning.
  We start with the observation that those methods crucially rely on the presence
  of a predictor network (and stop-gradient). With simple linear algebra, we show
  that when using a linear predictor, the optimal predictor is close to an orthogonal
  projection, and propose a general framework based on orthonormalization that enables
  to interpret and give intuition on why BYOL works. In addition, this framework demonstrates
  the crucial role of the exponential moving average and stop-gradient operator in
  BYOL as an efficient orthonormalization mechanism. We use these insights to propose
  four new closed-form predictor variants of BYOL to support our analysis. Our closed-form
  predictors outperform standard linear trainable predictor BYOL at 100 and 300 epochs
  (top-1 linear accuracy on ImageNet).
