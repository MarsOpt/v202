title: Compressed Decentralized Proximal Stochastic Gradient Method for Nonconvex
  Composite Problems with Heterogeneous Data
openreview: n9cpi2MSew
abstract: We first propose a decentralized proximal stochastic gradient tracking method
  (DProxSGT) for nonconvex stochastic composite problems, with data heterogeneously
  distributed on multiple workers in a decentralized connected network. To save communication
  cost, we then extend DProxSGT to a compressed method by compressing the communicated
  information. Both methods need only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ samples per worker for each
  proximal update, which is important to achieve good generalization performance on
  training deep neural networks. With a smoothness condition on the expected loss
  function (but not on each sample function), the proposed methods can achieve an
  optimal sample complexity result to produce a near-stationary point. Numerical experiments
  on training neural networks demonstrate the significantly better generalization
  performance of our methods over large-batch training methods and momentum variance-reduction
  methods and also, the ability of handling heterogeneous data by the gradient tracking
  scheme.
