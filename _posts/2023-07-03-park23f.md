title: Learning Controllable Degradation for Real-World Super-Resolution via Constrained
  Flows
openreview: M3IX2zAIdi
abstract: 'Recent deep-learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been successful
  in recovering high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts,
  albeit on the synthetic and simple degradation setting: bicubic downscaling. On
  the other hand, super-resolution on real-world images demands the capability to
  handle complex downscaling mechanism which produces different artifacts (e.g., noise,
  blur, color distortion) upon downscaling factors. To account for complex downscaling
  mechanism in real-world LR images, there have been a few efforts in constructing
  datasets consisting of LR images with real-world downsampling degradation. However,
  making such datasets entails a tremendous amount of time and effort, thereby resorting
  to very few number of downscaling factors (e.g., $\times$2, $\times$3, $\times$4).
  To remedy the issue, we propose to generate realistic SR datasets for unseen degradation
  levels by exploring the latent space of real LR images and thereby producing more
  diverse yet realistic LR images with complex real-world artifacts. Our quantitative
  and qualitative experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the generated LR images,
  and we show that the various conventional SR networks trained with our newly generated
  SR datasets can produce much better HR images.'
