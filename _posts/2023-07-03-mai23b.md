title: Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network for Recommender System
openreview: NRnS6CtbaN
abstract: 'Conventional recommender systems are required to train the recommendation
  model using a centralized database. However, due to data privacy concerns, this
  is often impractical when multi-parties are involved in recommender system training.
  Federated learning appears as an excellent solution to the data isolation and privacy
  problem. Recently, Graph neural network (GNN) is becoming a promising approach for
  federated recommender systems. However, a key challenge is to conduct embedding
  propagation while preserving the privacy of the graph structure. Few studies have
  been conducted on the federated GNN-based recommender system. Our study proposes
  the first vertical federated GNN-based recommender system, called VerFedGNN. We
  design a framework to transmit: (i) the summation of neighbor embeddings using random
  projection, and (ii) gradients of public parameter perturbed by ternary quantization
  mechanism. Empirical studies show that VerFedGNN has competitive prediction accuracy
  with existing privacy preserving GNN frameworks while enhanced privacy protection
  for usersâ€™ interaction information.'
