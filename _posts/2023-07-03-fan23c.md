title: 'LSDS++ : Dual Sampling for Accelerated k-means++'
openreview: Im0XEixDmR
abstract: k-means clustering is an important problem in machine learning and statistics.
  The k-means++ initialization algorithm has driven new acceleration strategies and
  theoretical analysis for solving the k-means clustering problem. The state-of-the-art
  variant, called LocalSearch++, adds extra local search steps upon k-means++ to achieve
  constant approximation error in expectation. In this paper, we propose a new variant
  named LSDS++, which improves the sampling efficiency of LocalSearch++ via a strategy
  called dual sampling. By defining a new capture graph based on the concept of coreset,
  we show that the proposed LSDS++ is able to achieve the same expected constant error
  with reduced complexity. Experiments are conducted to justify the benefit of LSDS++
  in practice.
