title: Deep Generative Symbolic Regression with Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search
openreview: vDMHusV7J0
abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) is the problem of learning a symbolic expression
  from numerical data. Recently, deep neural models trained on procedurally-generated
  synthetic datasets showed competitive performance compared to more classical Genetic
  Programming (GP) ones. Unlike their GP counterparts, these neural approaches are
  trained to generate expressions from datasets given as context. This allows them
  to produce accurate expressions in a single forward pass at test time. However,
  they usually do not benefit from search abilities, which result in low performance
  compared to GP on out-of-distribution datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
  method which provides the best of both worlds, based on a Monte-Carlo Tree Search
  procedure using a context-aware neural mutation model, which is initially pre-trained
  to learn promising mutations, and further refined from successful experiences in
  an online fashion. The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the
  well-known SRBench benchmark.
