title: Evaluating Self-Supervised Learning via Risk Decomposition
openreview: dEjB1SLDnt
abstract: 'Self-supervised learning (SSL) is typically evaluated using a single metric
  (linear probing on ImageNet), which neither provides insight into tradeoffs between
  models nor highlights how to improve them. To address this, we propose an SSL risk
  decomposition, which generalizes the classical approximation-estimation decomposition.
  Our decomposition consists of four error terms: approximation, representation usability,
  probe generalization, and encoder generalization. We provide efficient estimators
  for each term and use them to analyze the effect of 30 design choices on 169 SSL
  vision models evaluated on ImageNet. Our analysis gives valuable insights for designing
  and using SSL models. For example, it highlights the main source of errors and shows
  how to improve SSL in specific settings (full- vs few-shot) by trading off error
  components.'
