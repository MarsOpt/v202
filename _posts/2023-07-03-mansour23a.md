title: Random Classification Noise does not defeat All Convex Potential Boosters Irrespective
  of Model Choice
openreview: 1UaGAhLAsL
abstract: A landmark negative result of Long and Servedio has had a considerable impact
  on research and development in boosting algorithms, around the now famous tagline
  that "noise defeats all convex boosters". In this paper, we appeal to the half-century+
  founding theory of losses for class probability estimation, an extension of Long
  and Servedioâ€™s results and a new general convex booster to demonstrate that the
  source of their negative result is in fact the <em>model class</em>, linear separators.
  Losses or algorithms are neither to blame. This leads us to a discussion on an otherwise
  praised aspect of ML, <em>parameterisation</em>.
