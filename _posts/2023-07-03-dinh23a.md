title: 'PixelAsParam: A Gradient View on Diffusion Sampling with Guidance'
openreview: 2q1Whv1kXL
abstract: Diffusion models recently achieved state-of-the-art in image generation.
  They mainly utilize the denoising framework, which leverages the Langevin dynamics
  process for image sampling. Recently, the guidance method has modified this process
  to add conditional information to achieve a controllable generator. However, the
  current guidance on denoising processes suffers from the trade-off between diversity,
  image quality, and conditional information. In this work, we propose to view this
  guidance sampling process from a gradient view, where image pixels are treated as
  parameters being optimized, and each mathematical term in the sampling process represents
  one update direction. This perspective reveals more insights into the conflict problems
  between updated directions on the pixels, which cause the trade-off as mentioned
  previously. We investigate the conflict problems and propose to solve them by a
  simple projection method. The experimental results evidently improve over different
  baselines on datasets with various resolutions.
