title: Trustworthy Policy Learning under the Counterfactual No-Harm Criterion
openreview: s5v1TJklbL
abstract: Trustworthy policy learning has significant importance in making reliable
  and harmless treatment decisions for individuals. Previous policy learning approaches
  aim at the well-being of subgroups by maximizing the utility function (e.g., conditional
  average causal effects, post-view click-through&conversion rate in recommendations),
  however, individual-level counterfactual no-harm criterion has rarely been discussed.
  In this paper, we first formalize the counterfactual no-harm criterion for policy
  learning from a principal stratification perspective. Next, we propose a novel upper
  bound for the fraction negatively affected by the policy and show the consistency
  and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Based on the estimators for the policy
  utility and harm upper bounds, we further propose a policy learning approach that
  satisfies the counterfactual no-harm criterion, and prove its consistency to the
  optimal policy reward for parametric and non-parametric policy classes, respectively.
  Extensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed policy
  learning approach for satisfying the counterfactual no-harm criterion.
