title: 'Prompting Large Language Model for Machine Translation: A Case Study'
openreview: yWl0agiI0y
abstract: Research on prompting has shown excellent performance with little or even
  no supervised training across many tasks. However, prompting for machine translation
  is still under-explored in the literature. We fill this gap by offering a systematic
  study on prompting strategies for translation, examining various factors for prompt
  template and demonstration example selection. We further explore the use of monolingual
  data and the feasibility of cross-lingual, cross-domain, and sentence-to-document
  transfer learning in prompting. Extensive experiments with GLM-130B (Zeng et al.,
  2022) as the testbed show that 1) the number and the quality of prompt examples
  matter, where using suboptimal examples degenerates translation; 2) several features
  of prompt examples, such as semantic similarity, show significant Spearman correlation
  with their prompting performance; yet, none of the correlations are strong enough;
  3) using pseudo parallel prompt examples constructed from monolingual data via zero-shot
  prompting could improve translation; and 4) improved performance is achievable by
  transferring knowledge from prompt examples selected in other settings. We finally
  provide an analysis on the model outputs and discuss several problems that prompting
  still suffers from.
