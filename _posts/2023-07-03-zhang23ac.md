title: Detecting Adversarial Data by Probing Multiple Perturbations Using Expected
  Perturbation Score
openreview: QveIdCjDUi
abstract: Adversarial detection aims to determine whether a given sample is an adversarial
  one based on the discrepancy between natural and adversarial distributions. Unfortunately,
  estimating or comparing two data distributions is extremely difficult, especially
  in high-dimension spaces. Recently, the gradient of log probability density (a.k.a.,
  score) w.r.t. the sample is used as an alternative statistic to compute. However,
  we find that the score is sensitive in identifying adversarial samples due to insufficient
  information with one sample only. In this paper, we propose a new statistic called
  expected perturbation score (EPS), which is essentially the expected score of a
  sample after various perturbations. Specifically, to obtain adequate information
  regarding one sample, we perturb it by adding various noises to capture its multi-view
  observations. We theoretically prove that EPS is a proper statistic to compute the
  discrepancy between two samples under mild conditions. In practice, we can use a
  pre-trained diffusion model to estimate EPS for each sample. Last, we pro- pose
  an EPS-based adversarial detection (EPS- AD) method, in which we develop EPS-based
  maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to measure the discrepancy between the
  test sample and natural samples. We also prove that the EPS-based MMD between natural
  and adversarial samples is larger than that among natural samples. Extensive experiments
  show the superior adversarial detection performance of our EPS-AD.
