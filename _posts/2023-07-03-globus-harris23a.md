title: Multicalibration as Boosting for Regression
openreview: RrusCGfAZ1
abstract: We study the connection between multicalibration and boosting for squared
  error regression. First we prove a useful characterization of multicalibration in
  terms of a “swap regret” like condition on squared error. Using this characterization,
  we give an exceedingly simple algorithm that can be analyzed both as a boosting
  algorithm for regression and as a multicalibration algorithm for a class $\mathcal{H}$
  that makes use only of a standard squared error regression oracle for $\mathcal{H}$.
  We give a weak learning assumption on $\mathcal{H}$ that ensures convergence to
  Bayes optimality without the need to make any realizability assumptions — giving
  us an agnostic boosting algorithm for regression. We then show that our weak learning
  assumption on $\mathcal{H}$ is both necessary and sufficient for multicalibration
  with respect to $\mathcal{H}$ to imply Bayes optimality, answering an open question.
  We also show that if $\mathcal{H}$ satisfies our weak learning condition relative
  to another class $\mathcal{C}$ then multicalibration with respect to $\mathcal{H}$
  implies multicalibration with respect to $\mathcal{C}$. Finally we investigate the
  empirical performance of our algorithm experimentally.
