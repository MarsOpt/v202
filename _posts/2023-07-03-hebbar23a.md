title: 'CRISP: Curriculum based Sequential neural decoders for Polar code family'
openreview: tFT8JlB1nl
abstract: Polar codes are widely used state-of-the-art codes for reliable communication
  that have recently been included in the $5^{\text{th}}$ generation wireless standards
  ($5$G). However, there still remains room for design of polar decoders that are
  both efficient and reliable in the short blocklength regime. Motivated by recent
  successes of data-driven channel decoders, we introduce a novel $\textbf{ C}$ur${\textbf{RI}}$culum
  based $\textbf{S}$equential neural decoder for $\textbf{P}$olar codes (CRISP). We
  design a principled curriculum, guided by information-theoretic insights, to train
  CRISP and show that it outperforms the successive-cancellation (SC) decoder and
  attains near-optimal reliability performance on the $\text{Polar}(32,16)$ and $\text{Polar}(64,22)$
  codes. The choice of the proposed curriculum is critical in achieving the accuracy
  gains of CRISP, as we show by comparing against other curricula. More notably, CRISP
  can be readily extended to Polarization-Adjusted-Convolutional (PAC) codes, where
  existing SC decoders are significantly less reliable. To the best of our knowledge,
  CRISP constructs the first data-driven decoder for PAC codes and attains near-optimal
  performance on the $\text{PAC}(32,16)$ code.
