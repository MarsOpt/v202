  Meshes'
openreview: HGVnUS6OYN
abstract: Learning-based high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D shapes with varying topology
  is a fundamental problem in computer vision and computer graphics. Recent advances
  in learning 3D shapes using explicit and implicit representations have achieved
  impressive results in 3D modeling. However, the template-based explicit representation
  is limited by fixed topology, and the implicit representation, although flexible
  with arbitrary topology, requires a large number of sampled points to regress the
  surface, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel 3D
  shape representation named NeuralSlice, which represents a 3D shape as the intersection
  of a 4D tetrahedral mesh and a 4D hyperplane. A novel network is designed to incorporate
  the proposed representation flexibly, which learns a deformable 4D template and
  a parameter for slicing 4D hyperplane to reconstruct the 3D object. To learn the
  local deformation of the 4D template, we further propose a spatial-aware network
  to locate the 4D points within the 3D feature volume of input shape via positional
  encoding, which leverages the local geometrical feature to guide the 4D deformation.
  By addressing the 3D problem in a higher 4D space, our method supports flexible
  topology changes while being highly efficient. Our method is guaranteed to produce
  manifold meshes. NeuralSlice outperforms the state-of-the-art explicit-based approaches
  in terms of reconstruction quality. Compared with implicit approaches, by avoiding
  point sampling, our method is 10 times faster than the implicit approaches, and
  better preserves thin structures. NeuralSlice has the capability of representing
  various shapes and topologies using a single 4D tetrahedral mesh. The corresponding
