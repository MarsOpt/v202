title: 'Semi-Dual Unbalanced Quadratic Optimal Transport: fast statistical rates and
  convergent algorithm.'
openreview: zodnF0pqK7
abstract: In this paper, we derive a semi-dual formulation for the problem of unbalanced
  quadratic optimal transport and we study its stability properties, namely we give
  upper and lower bounds for the Bregman divergence of the new objective that hold
  globally. We observe that the new objective gains even more convexity than in the
  balanced case. We use this formulation to prove the first results on statistical
  estimation of UOT potentials and we leverage the extra convexity to recover super-parametric
  rates. Interestingly, unlike in the balanced case, we do not require the potentials
  to be smooth. Then, use variable metric descent to solve the semi-dual problem for
  which we prove convergence at a $1/k$ rate for strongly convex potentials and exponential
  convergence in the balanced case when potentials are also smooth. We emphasize that
  our convergence results has an interest on its own as it generalizes previous convergence
  results to non-equivalent metrics. Last, we instantiate a proof-of-concept tractable
  version of our theoretical algorithm that we benchmark on a 2D experiment in the
  balanced case and on a medium dimension synthetic experiment in the unbalanced case.
