title: A General Representation Learning Framework with Generalization Performance
  Guarantees
openreview: 2rNiCN94NY
abstract: The generalization performance of machine learning methods depends heavily
  on the quality of data representation. However, existing researches rarely consider
  representation learning from the perspective of generalization error. In this paper,
  we prove that generalization error of representation learning function can be estimated
  effectively by solving two convex optimization problems. Based on it, we propose
  a general representation learning framework. And then, we apply the proposed framework
  to two most commonly used nonlinear mapping methods, i.e., kernel based method and
  deep neural network (DNN), and thus design a kernel selection method and a DNN boosting
  framework, correspondingly. Finally, extensive experiments verify the effectiveness
  of the proposed methods.
