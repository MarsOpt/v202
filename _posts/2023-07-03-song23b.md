title: 'LipsNet: A Smooth and Robust Neural Network with Adaptive Lipschitz Constant
  for High Accuracy Optimal Control'
openreview: ud9QEKm0Ym
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for solving optimal
  control problems. However, RL-trained policies often suffer from the action fluctuation
  problem, where the consecutive actions significantly differ despite only slight
  state variations. This problem results in mechanical componentsâ€™ wear and tear and
  poses safety hazards. The action fluctuation is caused by the high Lipschitz constant
  of actor networks. To address this problem, we propose a neural network named LipsNet.
  We propose the Multi-dimensional Gradient Normalization (MGN) method, to constrain
  the Lipschitz constant of networks with multi-dimensional input and output. Benefiting
  from MGN, LipsNet achieves Lipschitz continuity, allowing smooth actions while preserving
  control performance by adjusting Lipschitz constant. LipsNet addresses the action
  fluctuation problem at network level rather than algorithm level, which can serve
  as actor networks in most RL algorithms, making it more flexible and user-friendly
  than previous works. Experiments demonstrate that LipsNet has good landscape smoothness
  and noise robustness, resulting in significantly smoother action compared to the
  Multilayer Perceptron.
