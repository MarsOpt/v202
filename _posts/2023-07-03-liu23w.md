title: Oscillation-free Quantization for Low-bit Vision Transformers
openreview: DihXH24AdY
abstract: 'Weight oscillation is a by-product of quantization-aware training, in which
  quantized weights frequently jump between two quantized levels, resulting in training
  instability and a sub-optimal final model. We discover that the learnable scaling
  factor, a widely-used $\textit{de facto}$ setting in quantization aggravates weight
  oscillation. In this work, we investigate the connection between learnable scaling
  factor and quantized weight oscillation using ViT, and we additionally find that
  the interdependence between quantized weights in $\textit{query}$ and $\textit{key}$
  of a self-attention layer also makes ViT vulnerable to oscillation. We propose three
  techniques correspondingly: statistical weight quantization ($\rm StatsQ$) to improve
  quantization robustness compared to the prevalent learnable-scale-based method;
  confidence-guided annealing ($\rm CGA$) that freezes the weights with $\textit{high
  confidence}$ and calms the oscillating weights; and $\textit{query}$-$\textit{key}$
  reparameterization ($\rm QKR$) to resolve the query-key intertwined oscillation
  and mitigate the resulting gradient misestimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  that our algorithms successfully abate weight oscillation and consistently achieve
  substantial accuracy improvement on ImageNet. Specifically, our 2-bit DeiT-T/DeiT-S
  surpass the previous state-of-the-art by 9.8% and 7.7%, respectively. The code is
  included in the supplementary material and will be released.'
