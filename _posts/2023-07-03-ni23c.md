title: Continual Vision-Language Representation Learning with Off-Diagonal Information
openreview: XqtpvTnJum
abstract: 'Large-scale multi-modal contrastive learning frameworks like CLIP typically
  require a large amount of image-text samples for training. However, these samples
  are always collected continuously in real scenarios. This paper discusses the feasibility
  of continual CLIP training using streaming data. Unlike continual learning based
  on self-supervised learning methods for pure images, which is empirically robust
  against catastrophic forgetting, CLIP’s performance degeneration in the continual
  setting is significant and non-neglectable. By analyzing the changes in the model’s
  representation space during continual CLIP training from a spatial geometry perspective,
  we explore and summarize these spatial variations as <b>Spatial Disorder (SD)</b>,
  which can be divided into <b>Intra-modal Rotation</b> and <b>Inter-modal Deviation</b>.
  Moreover, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate how SD leads to a performance
  decline for CLIP on cross-modal retrieval tasks. To alleviate SD, we propose a new
  continual vision-language representation learning framework <b>Mod-X</b>: <b>M</b>aintain
  <b>o</b>ff-<b>d</b>iagonal information-matri<b>X</b>. By selectively aligning the
  off-diagonal information distribution of contrastive matrices, the Mod-X improves
  the capability of the multi-modal model by maintaining the multi-modal representation
  space alignment on the old data domain during continuously fitting the new training
  data domain. Experiments on commonly used datasets with different scales and scopes
  have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.'
