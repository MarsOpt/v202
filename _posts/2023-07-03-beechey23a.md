title: Explaining Reinforcement Learning with Shapley Values
openreview: R1blujRwj1
abstract: For reinforcement learning systems to be widely adopted, their users must
  understand and trust them. We present a theoretical analysis of explaining reinforcement
  learning using Shapley values, following a principled approach from game theory
  for identifying the contribution of individual players to the outcome of a cooperative
  game. We call this general framework Shapley Values for Explaining Reinforcement
  Learning (SVERL). Our analysis exposes the limitations of earlier uses of Shapley
  values in reinforcement learning. We then develop an approach that uses Shapley
  values to explain agent performance. In a variety of domains, SVERL produces meaningful
  explanations that match and supplement human intuition.
