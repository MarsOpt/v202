title: Directed Chain Generative Adversarial Networks
openreview: mozREzZ5oK
abstract: Real-world data can be multimodal distributed, e.g., data describing the
  opinion divergence in a community, the interspike interval distribution of neurons,
  and the oscillators natural frequencies. Generating multimodal distributed real-world
  data has become a challenge to existing generative adversarial networks (GANs).
  For example, it is often observed that Neural SDEs have only demonstrated successfully
  performance mainly in generating unimodal time series datasets. In this paper, we
  propose a novel time series generator, named directed chain GANs (DC-GANs), which
  inserts a time series dataset (called a neighborhood process of the directed chain
  or input) into the drift and diffusion coefficients of the directed chain SDEs with
  distributional constraints. DC-GANs can generate new time series of the same distribution
  as the neighborhood process, and the neighborhood process will provide the key step
  in learning and generating multimodal distributed time series. The proposed DC-GANs
  are examined on four datasets, including two stochastic models from social sciences
  and computational neuroscience, and two real-world datasets on stock prices and
  energy consumption. To our best knowledge, DC-GANs are the first work that can generate
  multimodal time series data and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks
  with respect to measures of distribution, data similarity, and predictive ability.
