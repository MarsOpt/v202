title: Learning Instance-Specific Augmentations by Capturing Local Invariances
openreview: 7W1uE3BjPO
abstract: We introduce InstaAug, a method for automatically learning input-specific
  augmentations from data. Previous methods for learning augmentations have typically
  assumed independence between the original input and the transformation applied to
  that input. This can be highly restrictive, as the invariances we hope our augmentation
  will capture are themselves often highly input dependent. InstaAug instead introduces
  a learnable invariance module that maps from inputs to tailored transformation parameters,
  allowing local invariances to be captured. This can be simultaneously trained alongside
  the downstream model in a fully end-to-end manner, or separately learned for a pre-trained
  model. We empirically demonstrate that InstaAug learns meaningful input-dependent
  augmentations for a wide range of transformation classes, which in turn provides
  better performance on both supervised and self-supervised tasks.
