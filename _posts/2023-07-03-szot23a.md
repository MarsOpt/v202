title: Adaptive Coordination in Social Embodied Rearrangement
openreview: BYEsw113sz
abstract: We present the task of "Social Rearrangement", consisting of cooperative
  everyday tasks like setting up the dinner table, tidying a house or unpacking groceries
  in a simulated multi-agent environment. In Social Rearrangement, two robots coordinate
  to complete a long-horizon task, using onboard sensing and egocentric observations,
  and no privileged information about the environment. We study zero-shot coordination
  (ZSC) in this task, where an agent collaborates with a new partner, emulating a
  scenario where a robot collaborates with a new human partner. Prior ZSC approaches
  struggle to generalize in our complex and visually rich setting, and on further
  analysis, we find that they fail to generate diverse coordination behaviors at training
  time. To counter this, we propose Behavior Diversity Play (BDP), a novel ZSC approach
  that encourages diversity through a discriminability objective. Our results demonstrate
  that BDP learns adaptive agents that can tackle visual coordination, and zero-shot
  generalize to new partners in unseen environments, achieving 35% higher success
  and 32% higher efficiency compared to baselines.
