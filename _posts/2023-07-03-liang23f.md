title: Learning Compiler Pass Orders using Coreset and Normalized Value Prediction
openreview: DwEU2zXeHG
abstract: 'Finding the optimal pass sequence of compilation can lead to a significant
  reduction in program size. Prior works on compilation pass ordering have two major
  drawbacks. They either require an excessive budget (in terms of the number of compilation
  passes) at compile time or fail to generalize to unseen programs. In this work,
  instead of predicting passes sequentially, we directly learn a policy on the pass
  sequence space, which outperforms the default -Oz flag by an average of 4.5% over
  a large collection (4683) of unseen code repositories from diverse domains across
  14 datasets. To achieve this, we first identify a small set (termed coreset) of
  pass sequences that generally optimize the size of most programs. Then, a policy
  is learned to pick the optimal sequences by predicting the normalized values of
  the pass sequences in the coreset. Our results demonstrate that existing human-designed
  compiler passes can be improved with a simple yet effective technique that leverages
  pass sequence space which contains dense rewards, while approaches operating on
  the individual pass space may suffer from issues of sparse reward, and do not generalize
  well to held-out programs from different domains. Website: https://rlcompopt.github.io.'
