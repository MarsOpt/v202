title: Comparison of meta-learners for estimating multi-valued treatment heterogeneous
  effects
openreview: lJaAPdXgxL
abstract: Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) estimation is one of the main
  challenges in causal inference with observational data. In addition to Machine Learning
  based-models, nonparametric estimators called meta-learners have been developed
  to estimate the CATE with the main advantage of not restraining the estimation to
  a specific supervised learning method. This task becomes, however, more complicated
  when the treatment is not binary as some limitations of the naive extensions emerge.
  This paper looks into meta-learners for estimating the heterogeneous effects of
  multi-valued treatments. We consider different meta-learners, and we carry out a
  theoretical analysis of their error upper bounds as functions of important parameters
  such as the number of treatment levels, showing that the naive extensions do not
  always provide satisfactory results. We introduce and discuss meta-learners that
  perform well as the number of treatments increases. We empirically confirm the strengths
  and weaknesses of those methods with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.
