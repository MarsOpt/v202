title: Semi-Supervised Offline Reinforcement Learning with Action-Free Trajectories
openreview: 8Ln8Ai9kq1
abstract: 'Natural agents can effectively learn from multiple data sources that differ
  in size, quality, and types of measurements. We study this heterogeneity in the
  context of offline reinforcement learning (RL) by introducing a new, practically
  motivated semi-supervised setting. Here, an agent has access to two sets of trajectories:
  labelled trajectories containing state, action and reward triplets at every timestep,
  along with unlabelled trajectories that contain only state and reward information.
  For this setting, we develop and study a simple meta-algorithmic pipeline that learns
  an inverse dynamics model on the labelled data to obtain proxy-labels for the unlabelled
  data, followed by the use of any offline RL algorithm on the true and proxy-labelled
  trajectories. Empirically, we find this simple pipeline to be highly successful
  â€” on several D4RL benchmarks (Fu et al., 2020), certain offline RL algorithms can
  match the performance of variants trained on a fully labelled dataset even when
  we label only 10% of trajectories which are highly suboptimal. To strengthen our
  understanding, we perform a large-scale controlled empirical study investigating
  the interplay of data-centric properties of the labelled and unlabelled datasets,
  with algorithmic design choices (e.g., choice of inverse dynamics, offline RL algorithm)
  to identify general trends and best practices for training RL agents on semi-supervised
  offline datasets.'
