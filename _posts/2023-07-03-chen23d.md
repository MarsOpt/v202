title: Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization under a Quantile Loss
  Function
openreview: MX4LDCq9iS
abstract: We study $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private (DP) stochastic convex
  optimization under an $r$-th quantile loss function taking the form $c(u) = ru^+
  + (1-r)(-u)^+$. The function is non-smooth, and we propose to approximate it with
  a smooth function obtained by convolution smoothing, which enjoys both structure
  and bandwidth flexibility and can address outliers. This leads to a better approximation
  than those obtained from existing methods such as Moreau Envelope. We then design
  private algorithms based on DP stochastic gradient descent and objective perturbation,
  and show that both algorithms achieve (near) optimal excess generalization risk
  $O(\max\{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}, \frac{\sqrt{d\ln(1/\delta)}}{n\varepsilon}\})$. Through
  objective perturbation, we further derive an upper bound $O(\max\{\sqrt{\frac{d}{n}},
  \sqrt{\frac{d\ln(1/\delta)}{n\varepsilon}}\})$ on the parameter estimation error
  under mild assumptions on data generating processes. Some applications in private
  quantile regression and private inventory control will be discussed.
