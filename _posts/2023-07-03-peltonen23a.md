title: Fair Neighbor Embedding
openreview: g0zYQRWmFR
abstract: We consider fairness in dimensionality reduction. Nonlinear dimensionality
  reduction yields low dimensional representations that let users visualize and explore
  high-dimensional data. However, traditional dimensionality reduction may yield biased
  visualizations overemphasizing relationships of societal phenomena to sensitive
  attributes or protected groups. We introduce a framework of fair neighbor embedding,
  the Fair Neighbor Retrieval Visualizer, which formulates fair nonlinear dimensionality
  reduction as an information retrieval task whose performance and fairness are quantified
  by information retrieval criteria. The method optimizes low-dimensional embeddings
  that preserve high-dimensional data neighborhoods without yielding biased association
  of such neighborhoods to protected groups. In experiments the method yields fair
  visualizations outperforming previous methods.
