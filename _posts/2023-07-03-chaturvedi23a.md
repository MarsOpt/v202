title: Streaming Submodular Maximization with Differential Privacy
openreview: MZfoP1FimF
abstract: In this work, we study the problem of privately maximizing a submodular
  function in the streaming setting. Extensive work has been done on privately maximizing
  submodular functions in the general case when the function depends upon the private
  data of individuals. However, when the size of the data stream drawn from the domain
  of the objective function is large or arrives very fast, one must privately optimize
  the objective within the constraints of the streaming setting. We establish fundamental
  differentially private baselines for this problem and then derive better trade-offs
  between privacy and utility for the special case of decomposable submodular functions.
  A submodular function is decomposable when it can be written as a sum of submodular
  functions; this structure arises naturally when each summand function models the
  utility of an individual and the goal is to study the total utility of the whole
  population as in the well-known Combinatorial Public Projects Problem. Finally,
  we complement our theoretical analysis with experimental corroboration.
