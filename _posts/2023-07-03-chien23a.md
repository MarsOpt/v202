title: 'PINA: Leveraging Side Information in eXtreme Multi-label Classification via
  Predicted Instance Neighborhood Aggregation'
openreview: ltFbrFDbld
abstract: 'The eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) problem seeks to find relevant
  labels from an exceptionally large label space. Most of the existing XMC learners
  focus on the extraction of semantic features from input query text. However, conventional
  XMC studies usually neglect the side information of instances and labels, which
  can be of use in many real-world applications such as recommendation systems and
  e-commerce product search. We propose Predicted Instance Neighborhood Aggregation
  (PINA), a data augmentation method for the general XMC problem that leverages beneficial
  side information. Unlike most existing XMC frameworks that treat labels and input
  instances as featureless indicators and independent entries, PINA extracts information
  from the label metadata and the correlations among training instances. Extensive
  experimental results demonstrate the consistent gain of PINA on various XMC tasks
  compared to the state-of-the-art methods: PINA offers a gain in accuracy compared
  to standard XR-Transformers on five public benchmark datasets. Moreover, PINA achieves
  a $\sim 5$% gain in accuracy on the largest dataset LF-AmazonTitles-1.3M.'
