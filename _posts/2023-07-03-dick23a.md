title: Subset-Based Instance Optimality in Private Estimation
openreview: nm4NwFfp7a
abstract: We propose a new definition of instance optimality for differentially private
  estimation algorithms. Our definition requires an optimal algorithm to compete,
  simultaneously for every dataset $D$, with the best private benchmark algorithm
  that (a) knows $D$ in advance and (b) is evaluated by its worst-case performance
  on large subsets of $D$. That is, the benchmark algorithm need not perform well
  when potentially extreme points are added to $D$; it only has to handle the removal
  of a small number of real data points that already exist. This makes our benchmark
  significantly stronger than those proposed in prior work. We nevertheless show,
  for real-valued datasets, how to construct private algorithms that achieve our notion
  of instance optimality when estimating a broad class of dataset properties, including
  means, quantiles, and $\ell_p$-norm minimizers. For means in particular, we provide
  a detailed analysis and show that our algorithm simultaneously matches or exceeds
  the asymptotic performance of existing algorithms under a range of distributional
  assumptions.
