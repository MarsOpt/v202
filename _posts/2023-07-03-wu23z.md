title: Personalized Federated Learning under Mixture of Distributions
openreview: nmVOTsQGR9
abstract: The recent trend towards Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has garnered
  significant attention as it allows for the training of models that are tailored
  to each client while maintaining data privacy. However, current PFL techniques primarily
  focus on modeling the conditional distribution heterogeneity (i.e. concept shift),
  which can result in suboptimal performance when the distribution of input data across
  clients diverges (i.e. covariate shift). Additionally, these techniques often lack
  the ability to adapt to unseen data, further limiting their effectiveness in real-world
  scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, FedGMM, which
  utilizes Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to effectively fit the input data distributions
  across diverse clients. The model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood
  estimation utilizing a federated Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which is solved
  in closed form and does not assume gradient similarity. Furthermore, FedGMM possesses
  an additional advantage of adapting to new clients with minimal overhead, and it
  also enables uncertainty quantification. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and
  benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both PFL
  classification and novel sample detection.
