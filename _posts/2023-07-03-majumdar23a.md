title: Fundamental Tradeoffs in Learning with Prior Information
openreview: zPOs1vAViT
abstract: We seek to understand fundamental tradeoffs between the accuracy of prior
  information that a learner has on a given problem and its learning performance.
  We introduce the notion of prioritized risk, which differs from traditional notions
  of minimax and Bayes risk by allowing us to study such fundamental tradeoffs in
  settings where reality does not necessarily conform to the learner’s prior. We present
  a general reduction-based approach for extending classical minimax lower-bound techniques
  in order to lower bound the prioritized risk for statistical estimation problems.
  We also introduce a novel generalization of Fano’s inequality (which may be of independent
  interest) for lower bounding the prioritized risk in more general settings involving
  unbounded losses. We illustrate the ability of our framework to provide insights
  into tradeoffs between prior information and learning performance for problems in
  estimation, regression, and reinforcement learning.
