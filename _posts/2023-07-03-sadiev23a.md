title: 'High-Probability Bounds for Stochastic Optimization and Variational Inequalities:
  the Case of Unbounded Variance'
openreview: JCpQcyjI7W
abstract: 'During the recent years the interest of optimization and machine learning
  communities in high-probability convergence of stochastic optimization methods has
  been growing. One of the main reasons for this is that high-probability complexity
  bounds are more accurate and less studied than in-expectation ones. However, SOTA
  high-probability non-asymptotic convergence results are derived under strong assumptions
  such as boundedness of the gradient noise variance or of the objective’s gradient
  itself. In this paper, we propose several algorithms with high-probability convergence
  results under less restrictive assumptions. In particular, we derive new high-probability
  convergence results under the assumption that the gradient/operator noise has bounded
  central $\alpha$-th moment for $\alpha \in (1,2]$ in the following setups: (i) smooth
  non-convex / Polyak-Lojasiewicz / convex / strongly convex / quasi-strongly convex
  minimization problems, (ii) Lipschitz / star-cocoercive and monotone / quasi-strongly
  monotone variational inequalities. These results justify the usage of the considered
  methods for solving problems that do not fit standard functional classes studied
  in stochastic optimization.'
