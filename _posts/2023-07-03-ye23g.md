title: 'Towards Quantum Machine Learning for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization:
  a Quantum QAP Solver'
openreview: Brn6oCUVK5
abstract: 'Combinatorial optimization (CO) on the graph is a crucial but challenging
  research topic. Recent quantum algorithms provide a new perspective for solving
  CO problems and have the potential to demonstrate quantum advantage. Quantum Approximate
  Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a well-known quantum heuristic for CO constructed
  by a parametric quantum circuit. However, QAOA is originally designed for unconstrained
  problems and the circuit parameters and solutions are jointly solved with time-consuming
  iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum neural network (QNN) for learning
  CO problems in a supervised manner to achieve better and faster results. We focus
  on the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) with matching constraints and the node
  permutation invariance property. To this end, a quantum neural network called QAP-QNN
  is devised to translate the QAP into a constrained vertex classification task. Moreover,
  we study two QAP tasks: Graph Matching and Traveling Salesman Problem on TorchQauntum
  simulators, and empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.'
