title: Ewald-based Long-Range Message Passing for Molecular Graphs
openreview: vd5JYAml0A
abstract: 'Neural architectures that learn potential energy surfaces from molecular
  data have undergone fast improvement in recent years. A key driver of this success
  is the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) paradigm. Its favorable scaling with
  system size partly relies upon a spatial distance limit on messages. While this
  focus on locality is a useful inductive bias, it also impedes the learning of long-range
  interactions such as electrostatics and van der Waals forces. To address this drawback,
  we propose Ewald message passing: a nonlocal Fourier space scheme which limits interactions
  via a cutoff on frequency instead of distance, and is theoretically well-founded
  in the Ewald summation method. It can serve as an augmentation on top of existing
  MPNN architectures as it is computationally inexpensive and agnostic to architectural
  details. We test the approach with four baseline models and two datasets containing
  diverse periodic (OC20) and aperiodic structures (OE62). Across all models and datasets,
  we observe robust improvements in energy mean absolute errors, averaging 10% on
  OC20 and 16% on OE62. Our analysis shows an outsize impact of these improvements
  on structures with high long-range contributions to the ground-truth energy.'
