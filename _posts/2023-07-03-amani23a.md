title: Distributed Contextual Linear Bandits with Minimax Optimal Communication Cost
openreview: vTSLiw1GfJ
abstract: We study distributed contextual linear bandits with stochastic contexts,
  where $N$ agents/learners act cooperatively to solve a linear bandit-optimization
  problem with $d$-dimensional features over the course of $T$ rounds. For this problem,
  we derive the first ever information-theoretic lower bound $\Omega(dN)$ on the communication
  cost of any algorithm that performs optimally in a regret minimization setup. We
  then propose a distributed batch elimination version of the LinUCB algorithm, DisBE-LUCB,
  where the agents share information among each other through a central server. We
  prove that the communication cost of DisBE-LUCB, matches our lower bound up to logarithmic
  factors. In particular, for scenarios with known context distribution, the communication
  cost of DisBE-LUCB is only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(dN)$ and its regret is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{dNT})$,
  which is of the same order as that incurred by an optimal single-agent algorithm
  for $NT$ rounds. We also provide similar bounds for practical settings where the
  context distribution can only be estimated. Therefore, our proposed algorithm is
  nearly minimax optimal in terms of <em>both regret and communication cost</em>.
  Finally, we propose DecBE-LUCB, a fully decentralized version of DisBE-LUCB, which
  operates without a central server, where agents share information with their <em>immediate
  neighbors</em> through a carefully designed consensus procedure.
