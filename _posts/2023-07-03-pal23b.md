title: Controlled Differential Equations on Long Sequences via Non-standard Wavelets
openreview: bm2qVX0h09
abstract: Neural Controlled Differential equations (NCDE) are a powerful mechanism
  to model the dynamics in temporal sequences, e.g., applications involving physiological
  measures, where apart from the initial condition, the dynamics also depend on subsequent
  measures or even a different "control" sequence. But NCDEs do not scale well to
  longer sequences. Existing strategies adapt rough path theory, and instead model
  the dynamics over summaries known as log signatures. While rigorous and elegant,
  invertibility of these summaries is difficult, and limits the scope of problems
  where these ideas can offer strong benefits (reconstruction, generative modeling).
  For tasks where it is sensible to assume that the (long) sequences in the training
  data are a fixed length of temporal measurements – this assumption holds in most
  experiments tackled in the literature – we describe an efficient simplification.
  First, we recast the regression/classification task as an integral transform. We
  then show how restricting the class of operators (permissible in the integral transform),
  allows the use of a known algorithm that leverages non-standard Wavelets to decompose
  the operator. Thereby, our task (learning the operator) radically simplifies. A
  neural variant of this idea yields consistent improvements across a wide gamut of
  use cases tackled in existing works. We also describe a novel application on modeling
  tasks involving coupled differential equations.
