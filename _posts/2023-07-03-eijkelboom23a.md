title: E$(n)$ Equivariant Message Passing Simplicial Networks
openreview: hF65aKF8Bf
abstract: This paper presents $\mathrm{E}(n)$ Equivariant Message Passing Simplicial
  Networks (EMPSNs), a novel approach to learning on geometric graphs and point clouds
  that is equivariant to rotations, translations, and reflections. EMPSNs can learn
  high-dimensional simplex features in graphs (e.g. triangles), and use the increase
  of geometric information of higher-dimensional simplices in an $\mathrm{E}(n)$ equivariant
  fashion. EMPSNs simultaneously generalize $\mathrm{E}(n)$ Equivariant Graph Neural
  Networks to a topologically more elaborate counterpart and provide an approach for
  including geometric information in Message Passing Simplicial Networks, thereby
  serving as a proof of concept for combining geometric and topological information
  in graph learning. The results indicate that EMPSNs can leverage the benefits of
  both approaches, leading to a general increase in performance when compared to either
  method individually, being on par with state-of-the-art approaches for learning
  on geometric graphs. Moreover, the results suggest that incorporating geometric
  information serves as an effective measure against over-smoothing in message passing
  networks, especially when operating on high-dimensional simplicial structures.
