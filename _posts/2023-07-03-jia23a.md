title: Bidirectional Adaptation for Robust Semi-Supervised Learning with Inconsistent
  Data Distributions
openreview: dZA7WtCULT
abstract: 'Semi-supervised learning (SSL) suffers from severe performance degradation
  when labeled and unlabeled data come from inconsistent data distributions. However,
  there is still a lack of sufficient theoretical guidance on how to alleviate this
  problem. In this paper, we propose a general theoretical framework that demonstrates
  how distribution discrepancies caused by pseudo-label predictions and target predictions
  can lead to severe generalization errors. Through theoretical analysis, we identify
  three main reasons why previous SSL algorithms cannot perform well with inconsistent
  distributions: coupling between the pseudo-label predictor and the target predictor,
  biased pseudo labels, and restricted sample weights. To address these challenges,
  we introduce a practical framework called Bidirectional Adaptation that can adapt
  to the distribution of unlabeled data for debiased pseudo-label prediction and to
  the target distribution for debiased target prediction, thereby mitigating these
  shortcomings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  proposed framework.'
