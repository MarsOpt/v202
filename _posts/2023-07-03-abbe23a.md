title: Generalization on the Unseen, Logic Reasoning and Degree Curriculum
openreview: 3dqwXb1te4
abstract: 'This paper considers the learning of logical (Boolean) functions with focus
  on the generalization on the unseen (GOTU) setting, a strong case of out-of-distribution
  generalization. This is motivated by the fact that the rich combinatorial nature
  of data in certain reasoning tasks (e.g., arithmetic/logic) makes representative
  data sampling challenging, and learning successfully under GOTU gives a first vignette
  of an ’extrapolating’ or ’reasoning’ learner. We then study how different network
  architectures trained by (S)GD perform under GOTU and provide both theoretical and
  experimental evidence that for a class of network models including instances of
  Transformers, random features models, and diagonal linear networks, a min-degree-interpolator
  is learned on the unseen. We also provide evidence that other instances with larger
  learning rates or mean-field networks reach leaky min-degree solutions. These findings
  lead to two implications: (1) we provide an explanation to the length generalization
  problem (e.g., Anil et al. 2022); (2) we introduce a curriculum learning algorithm
  called Degree-Curriculum that learns monomials more efficiently by incrementing
  supports.'
