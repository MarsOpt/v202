title: 'Analysis of Error Feedback in Federated Non-Convex Optimization with Biased
  Compression: Fast Convergence and Partial Participation'
openreview: wbs1fKLfOe
abstract: In practical federated learning (FL) systems, the communication cost between
  the clients and the central server can often be a bottleneck. In this paper, we
  focus on biased gradient compression in non-convex FL problems. In the classical
  distributed learning, the method of error feedback (EF) is a common technique to
  remedy the downsides of biased gradient compression, but the performance of EF in
  FL still lacks systematic investigation. In this work, we study a compressed FL
  scheme with error feedback, named Fed-EF, with two variants depending on the global
  model optimizer. While directly applying biased compression in FL leads to poor
  convergence, we show that Fed-EF is able to match the convergence rate of the full-precision
  FL counterpart with a linear speedup w.r.t. the number of clients. Experiments verify
  that Fed-EF achieves the same performance as the full-precision FL approach, at
  the substantially reduced communication cost. Moreover, we develop a new analysis
  of the EF under partial participation (PP), an important scenario in FL. Under PP,
  the convergence rate of Fed-EF exhibits an extra slow-down factor due to a so-called
  “stale error compensation” effect, which is also justified in our experiments. Our
  results provide insights on a theoretical limitation of EF, and possible directions
  for improvements.
