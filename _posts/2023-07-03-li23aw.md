title: Optimal Arms Identification with Knapsacks
openreview: QTBSlCKj3Y
abstract: Best Arm Identification (BAI) is a general online pure exploration framework
  to identify optimal decisions among candidates via sequential interactions. We pioneer
  the Optimal Arms identification with Knapsacks (OAK) problem, which extends the
  BAI setting to model the resource consumption. We present a novel OAK algorithm
  and prove the upper bound of our algorithm by exploring the relationship between
  selecting optimal actions and the structure of the feasible region. Our analysis
  introduces a new complexity measure, which builds a bridge between the OAK setting
  and bandits with knapsacks problem. We establish the instance-dependent lower bound
  for the OAK problem based on the new complexity measure. Our results show that the
  proposed algorithm achieves a near-optimal probability bound for the OAK problem.
  In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm recovers or improves the state-of-the-art
  upper bounds for several special cases, including the simple OAK setting and some
  classical pure exploration problems.
