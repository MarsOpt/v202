title: Hierarchical Neural Coding for Controllable CAD Model Generation
openreview: 42BJcoGuMP
abstract: This paper presents a novel generative model for Computer Aided Design (CAD)
  that 1) represents high-level design concepts of a CAD model as a three-level hierarchical
  tree of neural codes, from global part arrangement down to local curve geometry;
  and 2) controls the generation or completion of CAD models by specifying the target
  design using a code tree. Concretely, a novel variant of a vector quantized VAE
  with "masked skip connection" extracts design variations as neural codebooks at
  three levels. Two-stage cascaded auto-regressive transformers learn to generate
  code trees from incomplete CAD models and then complete CAD models following the
  intended design. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on conventional
  tasks such as unconditional generation while enabling novel interaction capabilities
  on conditional generation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/samxuxiang/hnc-cad.
