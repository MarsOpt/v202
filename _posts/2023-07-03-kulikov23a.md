title: 'SinDDM: A Single Image Denoising Diffusion Model'
openreview: IJ70r39DzS
abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have led to staggering performance leaps
  in image generation, editing and restoration. However, existing DDMs use very large
  datasets for training. Here, we introduce a framework for training a DDM on a single
  image. Our method, which we coin SinDDM, learns the internal statistics of the training
  image by using a multi-scale diffusion process. To drive the reverse diffusion process,
  we use a fully-convolutional light-weight denoiser, which is conditioned on both
  the noise level and the scale. This architecture allows generating samples of arbitrary
  dimensions, in a coarse-to-fine manner. As we illustrate, SinDDM generates diverse
  high-quality samples, and is applicable in a wide array of tasks, including style
  transfer and harmonization. Furthermore, it can be easily guided by external supervision.
  Particularly, we demonstrate text-guided generation from a single image using a
  pre-trained CLIP model.
