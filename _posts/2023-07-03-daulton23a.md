title: 'Hypervolume Knowledge Gradient: A Lookahead Approach for Multi-Objective Bayesian
  Optimization with Partial Information'
openreview: aX9jtC2lfS
abstract: Bayesian optimization is a popular method for sample efficient multi-objective
  optimization. However, existing Bayesian optimization techniques fail to effectively
  exploit common and often-neglected problem structure such as decoupled evaluations,
  where objectives can be queried independently from one another and each may consume
  different resources, or multi-fidelity evaluations, where lower fidelity-proxies
  of the objectives can be evaluated at lower cost. In this work, we propose a general
  one-step lookahead acquisition function based on the Knowledge Gradient that addresses
  the complex question of what to evaluate when and at which design points in a principled
  Bayesian decision-theoretic fashion. Hence, our approach naturally addresses decoupled,
  multi-fidelity, and standard multi-objective optimization settings in a unified
  Bayesian decision making framework. By construction, our method is the one-step
  Bayes-optimal policy for hypervolume maximization. Empirically, we demonstrate that
  our method improves sample efficiency in a wide variety of synthetic and real-world
  problems. Furthermore, we show that our method is general-purpose and yields competitive
  performance in standard (potentially noisy) multi-objective optimization.
