title: 'RSC: Accelerate Graph Neural Networks Training via Randomized Sparse Computations'
openreview: GnsqiJwDzN
abstract: Training graph neural networks (GNNs) is extremely time consuming because
  sparse graph-based operations are hard to be accelerated by community hardware.
  Prior art successfully reduces the computation cost of dense matrix based operations
  (e.g., convolution and linear) via sampling-based approximation. However, unlike
  dense matrices, sparse matrices are stored in the irregular data format such that
  each row/column may have different number of non-zero entries. Thus, compared to
  the dense counterpart, approximating sparse operations has two unique challenges
  (1) we cannot directly control the efficiency of approximated sparse operation since
  the computation is only executed on non-zero entries; (2) sampling sparse matrices
  is much more inefficient due to the irregular data format. To address the issues,
  our key idea is to control the accuracy-efficiency trade off by optimizing computation
  resource allocation layer-wisely and epoch-wisely. For the first challenge, we customize
  the computation resource to different sparse operations, while limit the total used
  resource below a certain budget. For the second challenge, we cache previous sampled
  sparse matrices to reduce the epoch-wise sampling overhead. Finally, we propose
  a switching mechanisms to improve the generalization of GNNs trained with approximated
  operations. To this end, we propose Randomized Sparse Computation. In practice,
  rsc can achieve up to 11.6X speedup for a single sparse operation and 1.6X end-to-end
  wall-clock time speedup with almost no accuracy drop.
