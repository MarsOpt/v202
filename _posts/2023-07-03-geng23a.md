title: Towards Reliable Neural Specifications
openreview: gZXFNUcnHd
abstract: Having reliable specifications is an unavoidable challenge in achieving
  verifiable correctness, robustness, and interpretability of AI systems. Existing
  specifications for neural networks are in the paradigm of data as specification.
  That is, the local neighborhood centering around a reference input is considered
  to be correct (or robust). While existing specifications contribute to verifying
  adversarial robustness, a significant problem in many research domains, our empirical
  study shows that those verified regions are somewhat tight, and thus fail to allow
  verification of test set inputs, making them impractical for some real-world applications.
  To this end, we propose a new family of specifications called neural representation
  as specification. This form of specifications uses the intrinsic information of
  neural networks, specifically neural activation patterns (NAPs), rather than input
  data to specify the correctness and/or robustness of neural network predictions.
  We present a simple statistical approach to mining neural activation patterns. To
  show the effectiveness of discovered NAPs, we formally verify several important
  properties, such as various types of misclassifications will never happen for a
  given NAP, and there is no ambiguity between different NAPs. We show that by using
  NAP, we can verify a significant region of the input space, while still recalling
  84% of the data on MNIST. Moreover, we can push the verifiable bound to 10 times
  larger on the CIFAR10 benchmark. Thus, we argue that NAPs can potentially be used
  as a more reliable and extensible specification for neural network verification.
