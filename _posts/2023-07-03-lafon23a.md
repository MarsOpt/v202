title: Hybrid Energy Based Model in the Feature Space for Out-of-Distribution Detection
openreview: tpCynHFviX
abstract: 'Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical requirement for the deployment
  of deep neural networks. This paper introduces the HEAT model, a new post-hoc OOD
  detection method estimating the density of in-distribution (ID) samples using hybrid
  energy-based models (EBM) in the feature space of a pre-trained backbone. HEAT complements
  prior density estimators of the ID density, e.g. parametric models like the Gaussian
  Mixture Model (GMM), to provide an accurate yet robust density estimation. A second
  contribution is to leverage the EBM framework to provide a unified density estimation
  and to compose several energy terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significance
  of the two contributions. HEAT sets new state-of-the-art OOD detection results on
  the CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 benchmark as well as on the large-scale Imagenet benchmark.
