title: Learning to Design Analog Circuits to Meet Threshold Specifications
openreview: 38W1BXgAqx
abstract: Automated design of analog and radio-frequency circuits using supervised
  or reinforcement learning from simulation data has recently been studied as an alternative
  to manual expert design. It is straightforward for a design agent to learn an inverse
  function from desired performance metrics to circuit parameters. However, it is
  more common for a user to have threshold performance criteria rather than an exact
  target vector of feasible performance measures. In this work, we propose a method
  for generating from simulation data a dataset on which a system can be trained via
  supervised learning to design circuits to meet threshold specifications. We moreover
  perform the to-date most extensive evaluation of automated analog circuit design,
  including experimenting in a significantly more diverse set of circuits than in
  prior work, covering linear, nonlinear, and autonomous circuit configurations, and
  show that our method consistently reaches success rate better than 90% at 5% error
  margin, while also improving data efficiency by upward of an order of magnitude.
