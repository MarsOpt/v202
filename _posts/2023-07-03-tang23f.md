title: Towards Understanding Generalization of Graph Neural Networks
openreview: BhMyLk0YNy
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in machine learning for graph-structured
  data. Even though GNNs have achieved remarkable success in real-world applications,
  understanding their working mechanism in theory is still on primary stage. In this
  paper, we move towards this goal from the perspective of generalization. Specifically,
  with consideration of stochastic optimization, we establish high probability bounds
  of generalization gap and gradients for transductive learning algorithms. After
  that, we provide high probability bounds of generalization gap for popular GNNs
  and analyze the factors affecting their generalization capability. These theoretical
  results reveal how the network architecture impacts the generalization gap. Experiments
  on benchmark datasets validate the theoretical findings. Our results provide new
  insights into understanding generalization of GNNs.
