title: Expertise Trees Resolve Knowledge Limitations in Collective Decision-Making
openreview: Fd7NCsKLPF
abstract: Experts advising decision-makers are likely to display expertise which varies
  as a function of the problem instance. In practice, this may lead to sub-optimal
  or discriminatory decisions against minority cases. In this work, we model such
  changes in depth and breadth of knowledge as a partitioning of the problem space
  into regions of differing expertise. We provide here new algorithms that explicitly
  consider and adapt to the relationship between problem instances and experts’ knowledge.
  We first propose and highlight the drawbacks of a naive approach based on nearest
  neighbor queries. To address these drawbacks we then introduce a novel algorithm
  — expertise trees — that constructs decision trees enabling the learner to select
  appropriate models. We provide theoretical insights and empirically validate the
  improved performance of our novel approach on a range of problems for which existing
  methods proved to be inadequate.
