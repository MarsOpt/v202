title: Efficient preconditioned stochastic gradient descent for estimation in latent
  variable models
openreview: ikbUw7okHD
abstract: Latent variable models are powerful tools for modeling complex phenomena
  involving in particular partially observed data, unobserved variables or underlying
  complex unknown structures. Inference is often difficult due to the latent structure
  of the model. To deal with parameter estimation in the presence of latent variables,
  well-known efficient methods exist, such as gradient-based and EM-type algorithms,
  but with practical and theoretical limitations. In this paper, we propose as an
  alternative for parameter estimation an efficient preconditioned stochastic gradient
  algorithm. Our method includes a preconditioning step based on a positive definite
  Fisher information matrix estimate. We prove convergence results for the proposed
  algorithm under mild assumptions for very general latent variables models. We illustrate
  through relevant simulations the performance of the proposed methodology in a nonlinear
  mixed effects model and in a stochastic block model.
