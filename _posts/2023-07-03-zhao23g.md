title: 'Revisiting Simple Regret: Fast Rates for Returning a Good Arm'
openreview: qFk9EUzycd
abstract: Simple regret is a natural and parameter-free performance criterion for
  pure exploration in multi-armed bandits yet is less popular than the probability
  of missing the best arm or an $\epsilon$-good arm, perhaps due to lack of easy ways
  to characterize it. In this paper, we make a significant progress on minimizing
  simple regret in both data-rich ($T\ge n$) and data-poor regime ($T \le n$) where
  $n$ is the number of arms and $T$ is the number of samples. At its heart is our
  improved instance-dependent analysis of the well-known Sequential Halving (SH) algorithm
  where we bound the probability of returning an arm whose mean reward is not within
  $\epsilon$ from the best (i.e., not $\epsilon$-good) for <em>any</em> choice of
  $\epsilon>0$, although $\epsilon$ is not an input to SH. Our bound not only leads
  to an optimal worst-case simple regret bound of $\sqrt{n/T}$ up to logarithmic factors
  but also essentially matches the instance-dependent lower bound for returning an
  $\epsilon$-good arm reported by Katz-Samuels and Jamieson (2020). For the more challenging
  data-poor regime, we propose Bracketing SH (BSH) that enjoys the same improvement
  even without sampling each arm at least once. Our empirical study shows that BSH
  outperforms existing methods on real-world tasks.
