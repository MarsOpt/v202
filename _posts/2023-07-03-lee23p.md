title: On the Correctness of Automatic Differentiation for Neural Networks with Machine-Representable
  Parameters
openreview: Y0bPRkGJgP
abstract: 'Recent work has shown that forward- and reverse- mode automatic differentiation
  (AD) over the reals is almost always correct in a mathematically precise sense.
  However, actual programs work with machine-representable numbers (e.g., floating-point
  numbers), not reals. In this paper, we study the correctness of AD when the parameter
  space of a neural network consists solely of machine-representable numbers. In particular,
  we analyze two sets of parameters on which AD can be incorrect: the incorrect set
  on which the network is differentiable but AD does not compute its derivative, and
  the non-differentiable set on which the network is non-differentiable. For a neural
  network with bias parameters, we first prove that the incorrect set is always empty.
  We then prove a tight bound on the size of the non-differentiable set, which is
  linear in the number of non-differentiabilities in activation functions, and give
  a simple necessary and sufficient condition for a parameter to be in this set. We
  further prove that AD always computes a Clarke subderivative even on the non-differentiable
  set. We also extend these results to neural networks possibly without bias parameters.'
