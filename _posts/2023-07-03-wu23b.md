title: Causal Proxy Models for Concept-based Model Explanations
openreview: 1Hh1cIPJ7V
abstract: 'Explainability methods for NLP systems encounter a version of the fundamental
  problem of causal inference: for a given ground-truth input text, we never truly
  observe the counterfactual texts necessary for isolating the causal effects of model
  representations on outputs. In response, many explainability methods make no use
  of counterfactual texts, assuming they will be unavailable. In this paper, we show
  that robust causal explainability methods can be created using approximate counterfactuals,
  which can be written by humans to approximate a specific counterfactual or simply
  sampled using metadata-guided heuristics. The core of our proposal is the Causal
  Proxy Model (CPM). A CPM explains a black-box model $\mathcal{N}$ because it is
  trained to have the same <em>actual</em> input/output behavior as $\mathcal{N}$
  while creating neural representations that can be intervened upon to simulate the
  <em>counterfactual</em> input/output behavior of $\mathcal{N}$. Furthermore, we
  show that the best CPM for $\mathcal{N}$ performs comparably to $\mathcal{N}$ in
  making factual predictions, which means that the CPM can simply replace $\mathcal{N}$,
  leading to more explainable deployed models.'
