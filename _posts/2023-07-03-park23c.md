title: 'TRAK: Attributing Model Behavior at Scale'
openreview: PBRArApxMh
abstract: 'The goal of <em>data attribution</em> is to trace model predictions back
  to training data. Despite a long line of work towards this goal, existing approaches
  to data attribution tend to force users to choose between computational tractability
  and efficacy. That is, computationally tractable methods can struggle with accurately
  attributing model predictions in non-convex settings (e.g., in the context of deep
  neural networks), while methods that are effective in such regimes require training
  thousands of models, which makes them impractical for large models or datasets.
  In this work, we introduce TRAK (Tracing with the Randomly-projected After Kernel),
  a data attribution method that is both effective <em>and</em> computationally tractable
  for large-scale, differentiable models. In particular, by leveraging only a handful
  of trained models, TRAK can match the performance of attribution methods that require
  training thousands of models. We demonstrate the utility of TRAK across various
  modalities and scales: image classifiers trained on ImageNet, vision-language models
  (CLIP), and language models (BERT and mT5). We provide code for using TRAK (and
  reproducing our work) at https://github.com/MadryLab/trak .'
