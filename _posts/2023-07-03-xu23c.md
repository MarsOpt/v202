title: Bit Allocation using Optimization
openreview: vpXYb9vqU4
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of bit allocation in Neural Video
  Compression (NVC). First, we reveal a fundamental relationship between bit allocation
  in NVC and Semi-Amortized Variational Inference (SAVI). Specifically, we show that
  SAVI with GoP (Group-of-Picture)-level likelihood is equivalent to pixel-level bit
  allocation with precise rate & quality dependency model. Based on this equivalence,
  we establish a new paradigm of bit allocation using SAVI. Different from previous
  bit allocation methods, our approach requires no empirical model and is thus optimal.
  Moreover, as the original SAVI using gradient ascent only applies to single-level
  latent, we extend the SAVI to multi-level such as NVC by recursively applying back-propagating
  through gradient ascent. Finally, we propose a tractable approximation for practical
  implementation. Our method can be applied to scenarios where performance outweights
  encoding speed, and serves as an empirical bound on the R-D performance of bit allocation.
  Experimental results show that current state-of-the-art bit allocation algorithms
  still have a room of $\approx 0.5$ dB PSNR to improve compared with ours. Code is
