title: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Managing Risk in Multi-Agent Systems
openreview: MGDYQNXjCg
abstract: In order for agents in multi-agent systems (MAS) to be safe, they need to
  take into account the risks posed by the actions of other agents. However, the dominant
  paradigm in game theory (GT) assumes that agents are not affected by risk from other
  agents and only strive to maximise their expected utility. For example, in hybrid
  human-AI driving systems, it is necessary to limit large deviations in reward resulting
  from car crashes. Although there are equilibrium concepts in game theory that take
  into account risk aversion, they either assume that agents are risk-neutral with
  respect to the uncertainty caused by the actions of other agents, or they are not
  guaranteed to exist. We introduce a new GT-based Risk-Averse Equilibrium (RAE) that
  always produces a solution that minimises the potential variance in reward accounting
  for the strategy of other agents. Theoretically and empirically, we show RAE shares
  many properties with a Nash Equilibrium (NE), establishing convergence properties
  and generalising to risk-dominant NE in certain cases. To tackle large-scale problems,
  we extend RAE to the PSRO multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. We
  empirically demonstrate the minimum reward variance benefits of RAE in matrix games
  with high-risk outcomes. Results on MARL experiments show RAE generalises to risk-dominant
  NE in a trust dilemma game and that it reduces instances of crashing by 7x in an
  autonomous driving setting versus the best performing baseline.
