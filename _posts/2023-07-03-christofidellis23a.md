title: Unifying Molecular and Textual Representations via Multi-task Language Modelling
openreview: 7TLjOO4cvm
abstract: The recent advances in neural language models have also been successfully
  applied to the field of chemistry, offering generative solutions for classical problems
  in molecular design and synthesis planning. These new methods have the potential
  to fuel a new era of data-driven automation in scientific discovery. However, specialized
  models are still typically required for each task, leading to the need for problem-specific
  fine-tuning and neglecting task interrelations. The main obstacle in this field
  is the lack of a unified representation between natural language and chemical representations,
  complicating and limiting human-machine interaction. Here, we propose the first
  multi-domain, multi-task language model that can solve a wide range of tasks in
  both the chemical and natural language domains. Our model can handle chemical and
  natural language concurrently, without requiring expensive pre-training on single
  domains or task-specific models. Interestingly, sharing weights across domains remarkably
  improves our model when benchmarked against state-of-the-art baselines on single-domain
  and cross-domain tasks. In particular, sharing information across domains and tasks
  gives rise to large improvements in cross-domain tasks, the magnitude of which increase
  with scale, as measured by more than a dozen of relevant metrics. Our work suggests
  that such models can robustly and efficiently accelerate discovery in physical sciences
  by superseding problem-specific fine-tuning and enhancing human-model interactions.
