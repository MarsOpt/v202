title: '2D-Shapley: A Framework for Fragmented Data Valuation'
openreview: 35kjF0gqjA
abstract: Data valuation—quantifying the contribution of individual data sources to
  certain predictive behaviors of a model—is of great importance to enhancing the
  transparency of machine learning and designing incentive systems for data sharing.
  Existing work has focused on evaluating data sources with the shared feature or
  sample space. How to valuate fragmented data sources of which each only contains
  partial features and samples remains an open question. We start by presenting a
  method to calculate the counterfactual of removing a fragment from the aggregated
  data matrix. Based on the counterfactual calculation, we further propose 2D-Shapley,
  a theoretical framework for fragmented data valuation that uniquely satisfies some
  appealing axioms in the fragmented data context. 2D-Shapley empowers a range of
  new use cases, such as selecting useful data fragments, providing interpretation
  for sample-wise data values, and fine-grained data issue diagnosis.
