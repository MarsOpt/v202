title: Explore and Exploit the Diverse Knowledge in Model Zoo for Domain Generalization
openreview: IgpMs357b5
abstract: 'The proliferation of pretrained models, as a result of advancements in
  pretraining techniques, has led to the emergence of a vast zoo of publicly available
  models. Effectively utilizing these resources to obtain models with robust out-of-distribution
  generalization capabilities for downstream tasks has become a crucial area of research.
  Previous research has primarily focused on identifying the most powerful models
  within the model zoo, neglecting to fully leverage the diverse inductive biases
  contained within. This paper argues that the knowledge contained in weaker models
  is valuable and presents a method for leveraging the diversity within the model
  zoo to improve out-of-distribution generalization capabilities. Specifically, we
  investigate the behaviors of various pretrained models across different domains
  of downstream tasks by characterizing the variations in their encoded representations
  in terms of two dimensions: diversity shift and correlation shift. This characterization
  enables us to propose a new algorithm for integrating diverse pretrained models,
  not limited to the strongest models, in order to achieve enhanced out-of-distribution
  generalization performance. Our proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art empirical
  results on a variety of datasets, thus validating the benefits of utilizing diverse
  knowledge.'
