title: On Enhancing Expressive Power via Compositions of Single Fixed-Size ReLU Network
openreview: uIOw2ZE1U8
abstract: This paper explores the expressive power of deep neural networks through
  the framework of function compositions. We demonstrate that the repeated compositions
  of a single fixed-size ReLU network exhibit surprising expressive power, despite
  the limited expressive capabilities of the individual network itself. Specifically,
  we prove by construction that $\mathcal{L}_2\circ \boldsymbol{g}^{\circ r}\circ
  \boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}_1$ can approximate $1$-Lipschitz continuous functions on
  $[0,1]^d$ with an error $\mathcal{O}(r^{-1/d})$, where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is realized
  by a fixed-size ReLU network, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_2$ are
  two affine linear maps matching the dimensions, and $\boldsymbol{g}^{\circ r}$ denotes
  the $r$-times composition of $\boldsymbol{g}$. Furthermore, we extend such a result
  to generic continuous functions on $[0,1]^d$ with the approximation error characterized
  by the modulus of continuity. Our results reveal that a continuous-depth network
  generated via a dynamical system has immense approximation power even if its dynamics
  function is time-independent and realized by a fixed-size ReLU network.
