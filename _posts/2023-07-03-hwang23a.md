title: Combinatorial Neural Bandits
openreview: vDyKXNQrKL
abstract: 'We consider a contextual combinatorial bandit problem where in each round
  a learning agent selects a subset of arms and receives feedback on the selected
  arms according to their scores. The score of an arm is an unknown function of the
  armâ€™s feature. Approximating this unknown score function with deep neural networks,
  we propose algorithms: Combinatorial Neural UCB ($\texttt{CN-UCB}$) and Combinatorial
  Neural Thompson Sampling ($\texttt{CN-TS}$). We prove that $\texttt{CN-UCB}$ achieves
  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\tilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ or $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\tilde{d}
  T K})$ regret, where $\tilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of a neural tangent
  kernel matrix, $K$ is the size of a subset of arms, and $T$ is the time horizon.
  For $\texttt{CN-TS}$, we adapt an optimistic sampling technique to ensure the optimism
  of the sampled combinatorial action, achieving a worst-case (frequentist) regret
  of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\tilde{d} \sqrt{TK})$. To the best of our knowledge, these
  are the first combinatorial neural bandit algorithms with regret performance guarantees.
  In particular, $\texttt{CN-TS}$ is the first Thompson sampling algorithm with the
  worst-case regret guarantees for the general contextual combinatorial bandit problem.
  The numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performances of our proposed
  algorithms.'
