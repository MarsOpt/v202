title: 'Parallel $Q$-Learning: Scaling Off-policy Reinforcement Learning under Massively
  Parallel Simulation'
openreview: 4aECnTuPEq
abstract: Reinforcement learning is time-consuming for complex tasks due to the need
  for large amounts of training data. Recent advances in GPU-based simulation, such
  as Isaac Gym, have sped up data collection thousands of times on a commodity GPU.
  Most prior works have used on-policy methods like PPO due to their simplicity and
  easy-to-scale nature. Off-policy methods are more sample-efficient, but challenging
  to scale, resulting in a longer wall-clock training time. This paper presents a
  novel Parallel Q-Learning (PQL) scheme that outperforms PPO in terms of wall-clock
  time and maintains superior sample efficiency. The driving force lies in the parallelization
  of data collection, policy function learning, and value function learning. Different
  from prior works on distributed off-policy learning, such as Apex, our scheme is
  designed specifically for massively parallel GPU-based simulation and optimized
  to work on a single workstation. In experiments, we demonstrate the capability of
  scaling up Q-learning methods to tens of thousands of parallel environments and
  investigate important factors that can affect learning speed, including the number
  of parallel environments, exploration strategies, batch size, GPU models, etc. The
  code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/pql.
