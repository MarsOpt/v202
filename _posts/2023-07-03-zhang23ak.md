title: A Category-theoretical Meta-analysis of Definitions of Disentanglement
openreview: i0CVEg8kAN
abstract: Disentangling the factors of variation in data is a fundamental concept
  in machine learning and has been studied in various ways by different researchers,
  leading to a multitude of definitions. Despite the numerous empirical studies, more
  theoretical research is needed to fully understand the defining properties of disentanglement
  and how different definitions relate to each other. This paper presents a meta-analysis
  of existing definitions of disentanglement, using category theory as a unifying
  and rigorous framework. We propose that the concepts of the cartesian and monoidal
  products should serve as the core of disentanglement. With these core concepts,
  we show the similarities and crucial differences in dealing with (i) functions,
  (ii) equivariant maps, (iii) relations, and (iv) stochastic maps. Overall, our meta-analysis
  deepens our understanding of disentanglement and its various formulations and can
  help researchers navigate different definitions and choose the most appropriate
  one for their specific context.
