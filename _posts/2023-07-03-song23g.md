title: Importance Weighted Expectation-Maximization for Protein Sequence Design
openreview: 7viOT7Zs9G
abstract: Designing protein sequences with desired biological function is crucial
  in biology and chemistry. Recent machine learning methods use a surrogate sequence-function
  model to replace the expensive wet-lab validation. How can we efficiently generate
  diverse and novel protein sequences with high fitness? In this paper, we propose
  IsEM-Pro, an approach to generate protein sequences towards a given fitness criterion.
  At its core, IsEM-Pro is a latent generative model, augmented by combinatorial structure
  features from a separately learned Markov random fields (MRFs). We develop an Monte
  Carlo Expectation-Maximization method (MCEM) to learn the model. During inference,
  sampling from its latent space enhances diversity while its MRFs features guide
  the exploration in high fitness regions. Experiments on eight protein sequence design
  tasks show that our IsEM-Pro outperforms the previous best methods by at least 55%
  on average fitness score and generates more diverse and novel protein sequences.
