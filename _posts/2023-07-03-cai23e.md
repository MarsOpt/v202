title: Cyclic Block Coordinate Descent With Variance Reduction for Composite Nonconvex
  Optimization
openreview: 8hkpDHHP2O
abstract: Nonconvex optimization is central in solving many machine learning problems,
  in which block-wise structure is commonly encountered. In this work, we propose
  cyclic block coordinate methods for nonconvex optimization problems with non-asymptotic
  gradient norm guarantees. Our convergence analysis is based on a gradient Lipschitz
  condition with respect to a Mahalanobis norm, inspired by a recent progress on cyclic
  block coordinate methods. In deterministic settings, our convergence guarantee matches
  the guarantee of (full-gradient) gradient descent, but with the gradient Lipschitz
  constant being defined w.r.t. a Mahalanobis norm. In stochastic settings, we use
  recursive variance reduction to decrease the per-iteration cost and match the arithmetic
  operation complexity of current optimal stochastic full-gradient methods, with a
  unified analysis for both finite-sum and infinite-sum cases. We prove a faster linear
  convergence result when a Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PŁ) condition holds. To our knowledge,
  this work is the first to provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees — variance-reduced
  or not — for a cyclic block coordinate method in general composite (smooth + nonsmooth)
  nonconvex settings. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
  cyclic scheme in training deep neural nets.
