title: 'MAGANet: Achieving Combinatorial Generalization by Modeling a Group Action'
openreview: 0GyMsLGpsj
abstract: 'Combinatorial generalization refers to the ability to collect and assemble
  various attributes from diverse data to generate novel unexperienced data. This
  ability is considered a necessary passing point for achieving human-level intelligence.
  To achieve this ability, previous unsupervised approaches mainly focused on learning
  the disentangled representation, such as the variational autoencoder. However, recent
  studies discovered that the disentangled representation is insufficient for combinatorial
  generalization and is not even correlated. In this regard, we propose a novel framework
  for data generation that can robustly generalize under these distribution shift
  situations. Instead of representing each data, our model discovers the fundamental
  transformation between a pair of data by simulating a group action. To test the
  combinatorial generalizability, we evaluated our model in two settings: Recombination-to-Element
  and Recombination-to-Range. The experiments demonstrated that our method has quantitatively
  and qualitatively superior generalizability and generates better images than traditional
  models.'
