title: Adversarial Policies Beat Superhuman Go AIs
openreview: LX3VAhXNTw
abstract: We attack the state-of-the-art Go-playing AI system KataGo by training adversarial
  policies against it, achieving a $>$97% win rate against KataGo running at superhuman
  settings. Our adversaries do not win by playing Go well. Instead, they trick KataGo
  into making serious blunders. Our attack transfers zero-shot to other superhuman
  Go-playing AIs, and is comprehensible to the extent that human experts can implement
  it without algorithmic assistance to consistently beat superhuman AIs. The core
  vulnerability uncovered by our attack persists even in KataGo agents adversarially
  trained to defend against our attack. Our results demonstrate that even superhuman
  AI systems may harbor surprising failure modes. Example games are available https://goattack.far.ai/.
