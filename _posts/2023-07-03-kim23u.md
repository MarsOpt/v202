title: 'Prefer to Classify: Improving Text Classifiers via Auxiliary Preference Learning'
openreview: tAxfAKtwYe
abstract: 'The development of largely human-annotated benchmarks has driven the success
  of deep neural networks in various NLP tasks. To enhance the effectiveness of existing
  benchmarks, collecting new additional input-output pairs is often too costly and
  challenging, particularly considering their marginal impact on improving the current
  model accuracy. Instead, additional or complementary annotations on the existing
  input texts in the benchmarks can be preferable as an efficient way to pay the additional
  human cost. In this paper, we investigate task-specific preferences between pairs
  of input texts as a new alternative way for such auxiliary data annotation. From
  pair-wise comparisons with respect to the task, the auxiliary preference learning
  enables the model to learn an additional informative training signal that cannot
  be captured with instance-wise task labels. To this end, we propose a novel multi-task
  learning framework, called prefer-to-classify (P2C), which can enjoy the cooperative
  effect of learning both the given classification task and the auxiliary preferences.
  Here, we provide three different ways to collect preference signals in practice:
  (a) implicitly extracting from annotation records (for free, but often unavailable),
  (b) collecting explicitly from crowd workers (high paid), or (c) pre-trained large
  language models such as GPT-3 (low paid). Given existing classification NLP benchmarks,
  we demonstrate that the proposed auxiliary preference learning via P2C on them is
  effective in improving text classifiers. Our codes are publicly available.'
