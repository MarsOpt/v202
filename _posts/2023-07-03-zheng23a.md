title: Structure-informed Language Models Are Protein Designers
openreview: 1F2Opw8CGA
abstract: This paper demonstrates that language models are strong structure-based
  protein designers. We present LM-Design, a generic approach to reprogramming sequence-based
  protein language models (pLMs), that have learned massive sequential evolutionary
  knowledge from the universe of natural protein sequences, to acquire an immediate
  capability to design preferable protein sequences for given folds. We conduct a
  structural surgery on pLMs, where a lightweight structural adapter is implanted
  into pLMs and endows it with structural awareness. During inference, iterative refinement
  is performed to effectively optimize the generated protein sequences. Experiments
  show that LM-Design improves the state-of-the-art results by a large margin, leading
  to 4% to 12% accuracy gains in sequence recovery (e.g., 55.65%/56.63% on CATH 4.2/4.3
  single-chain benchmarks, and $>$60% when designing protein complexes). We provide
  extensive and in-depth analyses, which verify that LM-Design can (1) indeed leverage
  both structural and sequential knowledge to accurately handle structurally non-deterministic
  regions, (2) benefit from scaling data and model size, and (3) generalize to other
  proteins (e.g., antibodies and de novo proteins).
