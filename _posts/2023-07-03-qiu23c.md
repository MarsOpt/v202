title: Simple and Fast Group Robustness by Automatic Feature Reweighting
openreview: s5F1a6s1HS
abstract: A major challenge to out-of-distribution generalization is reliance on spurious
  features â€” patterns that are predictive of the class label in the training data
  distribution, but not causally related to the target. Standard methods for reducing
  the reliance on spurious features typically assume that we know what the spurious
  feature is, which is rarely true in the real world. Methods that attempt to alleviate
  this limitation are complex, hard to tune, and lead to a significant computational
  overhead compared to standard training. In this paper, we propose Automatic Feature
  Reweighting (AFR), an extremely simple and fast method for updating the model to
  reduce the reliance on spurious features. AFR retrains the last layer of a standard
  ERM-trained base model with a weighted loss that emphasizes the examples where the
  ERM model predicts poorly, automatically upweighting the minority group without
  group labels. With this simple procedure, we improve upon the best reported results
  among competing methods trained without spurious attributes on several vision and
  natural language classification benchmarks, using only a fraction of their compute.
