title: 'Subsample Ridge Ensembles: Equivalences and Generalized Cross-Validation'
openreview: s7me1XxUqd
abstract: We study subsampling-based ridge ensembles in the proportional asymptotics
  regime, where the feature size grows proportionally with the sample size such that
  their ratio converges to a constant. By analyzing the squared prediction risk of
  ridge ensembles as a function of the explicit penalty $\lambda$ and the limiting
  subsample aspect ratio $\phi_s$ (the ratio of the feature size to the subsample
  size), we characterize contours in the $(\lambda, \phi_s)$-plane at any achievable
  risk. As a consequence, we prove that the risk of the optimal full ridgeless ensemble
  (fitted on all possible subsamples) matches that of the optimal ridge predictor.
  In addition, we prove strong uniform consistency of generalized cross-validation
  (GCV) over the subsample sizes for estimating the prediction risk of ridge ensembles.
  This allows for GCV-based tuning of full ridgeless ensembles without sample splitting
  and yields a predictor whose risk matches optimal ridge risk.
