title: The Power of Preconditioning in Overparameterized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing
openreview: CN5J0UGZYg
abstract: We propose $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$, a preconditioned gradient descent
  method to tackle the low-rank matrix sensing problem when the true rank is unknown,
  and when the matrix is possibly ill-conditioned. Using overparametrized factor representations,
  $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ starts from a small random initialization, and proceeds
  by gradient descent with a specific form of preconditioning with a fixed damping
  term to combat overparameterization. At the expense of light computational overhead
  incurred by preconditioners, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ is remarkably robust
  to ill-conditioning compared to vanilla gradient descent ($\mathsf{GD}$). Specifically,
  we show that, under the Gaussian design, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ converges
  to the true low-rank matrix at a constant linear rate that is independent of the
  condition number (apart from a short nearly dimension-free burdening period), with
  near-optimal sample complexity. This significantly improves upon the convergence
  rate of vanilla $\mathsf{GD}$ which suffers from a polynomial dependency with the
  condition number. Our work provides evidence on the power of preconditioning in
  accelerating the convergence without hurting generalization in overparameterized
  learning.
