title: Multi-Modal Classifiers for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection
openreview: Nuymym2DZF
abstract: 'The goal of this paper is open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) â€” building
  a model that can detect objects beyond the set of categories seen at training, thus
  enabling the user to specify categories of interest at inference without the need
  for model retraining. We adopt a standard two- stage object detector architecture,
  and explore three ways for specifying novel categories: via language descriptions,
  via image exemplars, or via a combination of the two. We make three contributions:
  first, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate informative language descriptions
  for object classes, and construct powerful text-based classifiers; second, we employ
  a visual aggregator on image exemplars that can ingest any number of images as input,
  forming vision-based classifiers; and third, we provide a simple method to fuse
  information from language descriptions and image exemplars, yield- ing a multi-modal
  classifier. When evaluating on the challenging LVIS open-vocabulary bench- mark
  we demonstrate that: (i) our text-based classifiers outperform all previous OVOD
  works; (ii) our vision-based classifiers perform as well as text-based classifiers
  in prior work; (iii) using multi-modal classifiers perform better than either modality
  alone; and finally, (iv) our text-based and multi-modal classifiers yield better
  performance than a fully-supervised detector.'
