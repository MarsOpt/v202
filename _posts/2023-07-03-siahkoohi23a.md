title: 'Unearthing InSights into Mars: Unsupervised Source Separation with Limited
  Data'
openreview: CEFFBle9E6
abstract: Source separation involves the ill-posed problem of retrieving a set of
  source signals that have been observed through a mixing operator. Solving this problem
  requires prior knowledge, which is commonly incorporated by imposing regularity
  conditions on the source signals, or implicitly learned through supervised or unsupervised
  methods from existing data. While data-driven methods have shown great promise in
  source separation, they often require large amounts of data, which rarely exists
  in planetary space missions. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised
  source separation scheme for domains with limited data access that involves solving
  an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering covariance representation space—an
  interpretable, low-dimensional representation of stationary processes. We present
  a real-data example in which we remove transient, thermally-induced microtilts—known
  as glitches—from data recorded by a seismometer during NASA’s InSight mission on
  Mars. Thanks to the wavelet scattering covariances’ ability to capture non-Gaussian
  properties of stochastic processes, we are able to separate glitches using only
  a few glitch-free data snippets.
