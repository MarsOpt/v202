title: Predicting Rare Events by Shrinking Towards Proportional Odds
openreview: uSJP34JCTu
abstract: Training classifiers is difficult with severe class imbalance, but many
  rare events are the culmination of a sequence with much more common intermediate
  outcomes. For example, in online marketing a user first sees an ad, then may click
  on it, and finally may make a purchase; estimating the probability of purchases
  is difficult because of their rarity. We show both theoretically and through data
  experiments that the more abundant data in earlier steps may be leveraged to improve
  estimation of probabilities of rare events. We present PRESTO, a relaxation of the
  proportional odds model for ordinal regression. Instead of estimating weights for
  one separating hyperplane that is shifted by separate intercepts for each of the
  estimated Bayes decision boundaries between adjacent pairs of categorical responses,
  we estimate separate weights for each of these transitions. We impose an L1 penalty
  on the differences between weights for the same feature in adjacent weight vectors
  in order to shrink towards the proportional odds model. We prove that PRESTO consistently
  estimates the decision boundary weights under a sparsity assumption. Synthetic and
  real data experiments show that our method can estimate rare probabilities in this
  setting better than both logistic regression on the rare category, which fails to
  borrow strength from more abundant categories, and the proportional odds model,
  which is too inflexible.
