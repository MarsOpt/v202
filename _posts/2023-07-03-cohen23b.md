title: Few-Sample Feature Selection via Feature Manifold Learning
openreview: 0lufU7dRWA
abstract: In this paper, we present a new method for few-sample supervised feature
  selection (FS). Our method first learns the manifold of the feature space of each
  class using kernels capturing multi-feature associations. Then, based on Riemannian
  geometry, a composite kernel is computed, extracting the differences between the
  learned feature associations. Finally, a FS score based on spectral analysis is
  proposed. Considering multi-feature associations makes our method multivariate by
  design. This in turn allows for the extraction of the hidden manifold underlying
  the features and avoids overfitting, facilitating few-sample FS. We showcase the
  efficacy of our method on illustrative examples and several benchmarks, where our
  method demonstrates higher accuracy in selecting the informative features compared
  to competing methods. In addition, we show that our FS leads to improved classification
  and better generalization when applied to test data.
