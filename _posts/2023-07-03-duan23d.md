title: Are Equivariant Equilibrium Approximators Beneficial?
openreview: MLrquPs6OI
abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made by approximating Nash equilibrium
  (NE), correlated equilibrium (CE), and coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) through
  function approximation that trains a neural network to predict equilibria from game
  representations. Furthermore, equivariant architectures are widely adopted in designing
  such equilibrium approximators in normal-form games. In this paper, we theoretically
  characterize the benefits and limitations of equivariant equilibrium approximators.
  For the benefits, we show that they enjoy better generalizability than general ones
  and can achieve better approximations when the payoff distribution is permutation-invariant.
  For the limitations, we discuss their drawbacks in terms of equilibrium selection
  and social welfare. Together, our results help to understand the role of equivariance
  in equilibrium approximators.
