title: Nearly-Optimal Hierarchical Clustering for Well-Clustered Graphs
openreview: DdQTP1yFLQ
abstract: This paper presents two efficient hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithms
  with respect to Dasgupta’s cost function. For any input graph $G$ with a clear cluster-structure,
  our designed algorithms run in nearly-linear time in the input size of $G$, and
  return an $O(1)$-approximate HC tree with respect to Dasgupta’s cost function. We
  compare the performance of our algorithm against the previous state-of-the-art on
  synthetic and real-world datasets and show that our designed algorithm produces
  comparable or better HC trees with much lower running time.
