title: A Model-Based Method for Minimizing CVaR and Beyond
openreview: dWEKxwes02
abstract: We develop a variant of the stochastic prox-linear method for minimizing
  the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) objective. CVaR is a risk measure focused on
  minimizing worst-case performance, defined as the average of the top quantile of
  the losses. In machine learning, such a risk measure is useful to train more robust
  models. Although the stochastic subgradient method (SGM) is a natural choice for
  minimizing the CVaR objective, we show that our stochastic prox-linear (SPL+) algorithm
  can better exploit the structure of the objective, while still providing a convenient
  closed form update. Our SPL+ method also adapts to the scaling of the loss function,
  which allows for easier tuning. We then specialize a general convergence theorem
  for SPL+ to our setting, and show that it allows for a wider selection of step sizes
  compared to SGM. We support this theoretical finding experimentally.
