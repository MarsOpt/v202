title: Understanding the Role of Feedback in Online Learning with Switching Costs
openreview: haYpY2kDAb
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the role of feedback in online learning with switching
  costs. It has been shown that the minimax regret is $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$
  under bandit feedback and improves to $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$ under full-information
  feedback, where $T$ is the length of the time horizon. However, it remains largely
  unknown how the amount and type of feedback generally impact regret. To this end,
  we first consider the setting of bandit learning with extra observations; that is,
  in addition to the typical bandit feedback, the learner can freely make a total
  of $B_{\mathrm{ex}}$ <em>extra observations</em>. We fully characterize the minimax
  regret in this setting, which exhibits an interesting <em>phase-transition phenomenon</em>:
  when $B_{\mathrm{ex}} = O(T^{2/3})$, the regret remains $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$,
  but when $B_{\mathrm{ex}} = \Omega(T^{2/3})$, it becomes $\widetilde{\Theta}(T/\sqrt{B_{\mathrm{ex}}})$,
  which improves as the budget $B_{\mathrm{ex}}$ increases. To design algorithms that
  can achieve the minimax regret, it is instructive to consider a more general setting
  where the learner has a budget of $B$ <em>total</em> observations. We fully characterize
  the minimax regret in this setting as well and show that it is $\widetilde{\Theta}(T/\sqrt{B})$,
  which scales smoothly with the total budget $B$. Furthermore, we propose a generic
  algorithmic framework, which enables us to design different learning algorithms
  that can achieve matching upper bounds for both settings based on the amount and
  type of feedback. One interesting finding is that while bandit feedback can still
  guarantee optimal regret when the budget is relatively limited, it no longer suffices
  to achieve optimal regret when the budget is relatively large.'
