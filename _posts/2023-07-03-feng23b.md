title: Improved Online Learning Algorithms for CTR Prediction in Ad Auctions
openreview: rB0VaD44FZ
abstract: In this work, we investigate the online learning problem of revenue maximization
  in ad auctions, where the seller needs to learn the click-through rates (CTRs) of
  each ad candidate and charge the price of the winner through a pay-per-click manner.
  We focus on two models of the advertisersâ€™ strategic behaviors. First, we assume
  that the advertiser is completely myopic; i.e. in each round, they aim to maximize
  their utility only for the current round. In this setting, we develop an online
  mechanism based on upper-confidence bounds that achieves a tight $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret
  in the worst-case and negative regret when the values are static across all the
  auctions and there is a gap between the highest expected value (i.e. value multiplied
  by their CTR) and second highest expected value ad. Next, we assume that the advertiser
  is non-myopic and cares about their long term utility. This setting is much more
  complex since an advertiser is incentivized to influence the mechanism by bidding
  strategically in earlier rounds. In this setting, we provide an algorithm to achieve
  negative regret for the static valuation setting (with a positive gap), which is
  in sharp contrast with the prior work that shows $O(T^{2/3})$ regret when the valuation
  is generated by adversary.
