title: Trading-Off Payments and Accuracy in Online Classification with Paid Stochastic
  Experts
openreview: zIVu5Yidhm
abstract: We investigate online classification with paid stochastic experts. Here,
  before making their prediction, each expert must be paid. The amount that we pay
  each expert directly influences the accuracy of their prediction through some unknown
  Lipschitz “productivity” function. In each round, the learner must decide how much
  to pay each expert and then make a prediction. They incur a cost equal to a weighted
  sum of the prediction error and upfront payments for all experts. We introduce an
  online learning algorithm whose total cost after $T$ rounds exceeds that of a predictor
  which knows the productivity of all experts in advance by at most $\mathcal{O}\big(K^2(\ln
  T)\sqrt{T}\big)$ where $K$ is the number of experts. In order to achieve this result,
  we combine Lipschitz bandits and online classification with surrogate losses. These
  tools allow us to improve upon the bound of order $T^{2/3}$ one would obtain in
  the standard Lipschitz bandit setting. Our algorithm is empirically evaluated on
  synthetic data.
