title: Reliable Measures of Spread in High Dimensional Latent Spaces
openreview: sGvHRYUPeA
abstract: Understanding geometric properties of the latent spaces of natural language
  processing models allows the manipulation of these properties for improved performance
  on downstream tasks. One such property is the amount of data spread in a modelâ€™s
  latent space, or how fully the available latent space is being used. We demonstrate
  that the commonly used measures of data spread, average cosine similarity and a
  partition function min/max ratio I(V), do not provide reliable metrics to compare
  the use of latent space across data distributions. We propose and examine six alternative
  measures of data spread, all of which improve over these current metrics when applied
  to seven synthetic data distributions. Of our proposed measures, we recommend one
  principal component-based measure and one entropy-based measure that provide reliable,
  relative measures of spread and can be used to compare models of different sizes
  and dimensionalities.
