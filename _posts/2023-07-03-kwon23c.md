title: A Fully First-Order Method for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization
openreview: FZ1C5BXrfz
abstract: We consider stochastic unconstrained bilevel optimization problems when
  only the first-order gradient oracles are available. While numerous optimization
  methods have been proposed for tackling bilevel problems, existing methods either
  tend to require possibly expensive calculations regarding Hessians of lower-level
  objectives, or lack rigorous finite-time performance guarantees. In this work, we
  propose a Fully First-order Stochastic Approximation (F2SA) method, and study its
  non-asymptotic convergence properties. Specifically, we show that F2SA converges
  to an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of the bilevel problem after $\epsilon^{-7/2},
  \epsilon^{-5/2}$, and $\epsilon^{-3/2}$ iterations (each iteration using $O(1)$
  samples) when stochastic noises are in both level objectives, only in the upper-level
  objective, and not present (deterministic settings), respectively. We further show
  that if we employ momentum-assisted gradient estimators, the iteration complexities
  can be improved to $\epsilon^{-5/2}, \epsilon^{-4/2}$, and $\epsilon^{-3/2}$, respectively.
  We demonstrate even superior practical performance of the proposed method over existing
  second-order based approaches on MNIST data-hypercleaning experiments.
