title: 'Linearly Constrained Bilevel Optimization: A Smoothed Implicit Gradient Approach'
openreview: VwxjC1tm5o
abstract: This work develops analysis and algorithms for solving a class of bilevel
  optimization problems where the lower-level (LL) problems have linear constraints.
  Most of the existing approaches for constrained bilevel problems rely on value function-based
  approximate reformulations, which suffer from issues such as non-convex and non-differentiable
  constraints. In contrast, in this work, we develop an implicit gradient-based approach,
  which is easy to implement, and is suitable for machine learning applications. We
  first provide an in-depth understanding of the problem, by showing that the implicit
  objective for such problems is in general non-differentiable. However, if we add
  some small (linear) perturbation to the LL objective, the resulting implicit objective
  becomes differentiable almost surely. This key observation opens the door for developing
  (deterministic and stochastic) gradient-based algorithms similar to the state-of-the-art
  ones for unconstrained bi-level problems. We show that when the implicit function
  is assumed to be strongly-convex, convex, and weakly-convex, the resulting algorithms
  converge with guaranteed rate. Finally, we experimentally corroborate the theoretical
  findings and evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on numerical and
  adversarial learning problems.
