title: Fast Federated Machine Unlearning with Nonlinear Functional Theory
openreview: 6wQKmKiDHw
abstract: Federated machine unlearning (FMU) aims to remove the influence of a specified
  subset of training data upon request from a trained federated learning model. Despite
  achieving remarkable performance, existing FMU techniques suffer from inefficiency
  due to two sequential operations of training and retraining/unlearning on large-scale
  datasets. Our prior study, PCMU, was proposed to improve the efficiency of centralized
  machine unlearning (CMU) with certified guarantees, by simultaneously executing
  the training and unlearning operations. This paper proposes a fast FMU algorithm,
  FFMU, for improving the FMU efficiency while maintaining the unlearning quality.
  The PCMU method is leveraged to train a local machine learning (MU) model on each
  edge device. We propose to employ nonlinear functional analysis techniques to refine
  the local MU models as output functions of a Nemytskii operator. We conduct theoretical
  analysis to derive that the Nemytskii operator has a global Lipschitz constant,
  which allows us to bound the difference between two MU models regarding the distance
  between their gradients. Based on the Nemytskii operator and average smooth local
  gradients, the global MU model on the server is guaranteed to achieve close performance
  to each local MU model with the certified guarantees.
