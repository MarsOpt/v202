title: Differentially Private Hierarchical Clustering with Provable Approximation
  Guarantees
openreview: ayBKRjGDEI
abstract: 'Hierarchical Clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning method
  with decades of history and numerous applications. We initiate the study of <em>differentially-private</em>
  approximation algorithms for hierarchical clustering under the rigorous framework
  introduced by Dasgupta (2016). We show strong lower bounds for the problem: that
  any $\epsilon$-DP algorithm must exhibit $O(|V|^2/ \epsilon)$-additive error for
  an input dataset $V$. Then, we exhibit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm
  with $O(|V|^{2.5}/ \epsilon)$-additive error, and an exponential-time algorithm
  that meets the lower bound. To overcome the lower bound, we focus on the stochastic
  block model, a popular model of graphs, and, with a separation assumption on the
  blocks, propose a private $1+o(1)$ approximation algorithm which also recovers the
  blocks exactly. Finally, we perform an empirical study of our algorithms and validate
  their performance.'
