title: Towards Theoretical Understanding of Inverse Reinforcement Learning
openreview: dx5rPfq6Hr
abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) denotes a powerful family of algorithms
  for recovering a reward function justifying the behavior demonstrated by an expert
  agent. A well-known limitation of IRL is the ambiguity in the choice of the reward
  function, due to the existence of multiple rewards that explain the observed behavior.
  This limitation has been recently circumvented by formulating IRL as the problem
  of estimating the feasible reward set, i.e., the region of the rewards compatible
  with the expertâ€™s behavior. In this paper, we make a step towards closing the theory
  gap of IRL in the case of finite-horizon problems with a generative model. We start
  by formally introducing the problem of estimating the feasible reward set, the corresponding
  PAC requirement, and discussing the properties of particular classes of rewards.
  Then, we provide the first minimax lower bound on the sample complexity for the
  problem of estimating the feasible reward set of order ${\Omega}\left( \frac{H^3SA}{\epsilon^2}
  \left( \log \left(\frac{1}{\delta}\right) + S \right)\right)$, being $S$ and $A$
  the number of states and actions respectively, $H$ the horizon, $\epsilon$ the desired
  accuracy, and $\delta$ the confidence. We analyze the sample complexity of a uniform
  sampling strategy (US-IRL), proving a matching upper bound up to logarithmic factors.
  Finally, we outline several open questions in IRL and propose future research directions.
