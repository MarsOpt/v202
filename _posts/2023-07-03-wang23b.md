title: Improved Active Multi-Task Representation Learning via Lasso
openreview: RHjLINycna
abstract: To leverage the copious amount of data from source tasks and overcome the
  scarcity of the target task samples, representation learning based on multi-task
  pretraining has become a standard approach in many applications. However, up until
  now, most existing works design a source task selection strategy from a purely empirical
  perspective. Recently, Chen et al., 2022 gave the first active multi-task representation
  learning (A-MTRL) algorithm which adaptively samples from source tasks and can provably
  reduce the total sample complexity using the L2-regularized-target-source-relevance
  parameter $\nu^2$. But their work is theoretically suboptimal in terms of total
  source sample complexity and is less practical in some real-world scenarios where
  sparse training source task selection is desired. In this paper, we address both
  issues. Specifically, we show the strict dominance of the L1-regularized-relevance-based
  ($\nu^1$-based) strategy by giving a lower bound for the $\nu^2$-based strategy.
  When $\nu^1$ is unknown, we propose a practical algorithm that uses the LASSO program
  to estimate $\nu^1$. Our algorithm successfully recovers the optimal result in the
  known case. In addition to our sample complexity results, we also characterize the
  potential of our $\nu^1$-based strategy in sample-cost-sensitive settings. Finally,
  we provide experiments on real-world computer vision datasets to illustrate the
  effectiveness of our proposed method.
