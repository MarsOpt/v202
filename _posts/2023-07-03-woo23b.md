title: Learning Deep Time-index Models for Time Series Forecasting
openreview: pgcfCCNQXO
abstract: Deep learning has been actively applied to time series forecasting, leading
  to a deluge of new methods, belonging to the class of historical-value models. Yet,
  despite the attractive properties of time-index models, such as being able to model
  the continuous nature of underlying time series dynamics, little attention has been
  given to them. Indeed, while naive deep time-index models are far more expressive
  than the manually predefined function representations of classical time-index models,
  they are inadequate for forecasting, being unable to generalize to unseen time steps
  due to the lack of inductive bias. In this paper, we propose DeepTime, a meta-optimization
  framework to learn deep time-index models which overcome these limitations, yielding
  an efficient and accurate forecasting model. Extensive experiments on real world
  datasets in the long sequence time-series forecasting setting demonstrate that our
  approach achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods, and is highly
  efficient. Code is available at https://github.com/salesforce/DeepTime.
