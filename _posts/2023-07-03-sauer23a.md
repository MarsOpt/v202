title: 'StyleGAN-T: Unlocking the Power of GANs for Fast Large-Scale Text-to-Image
  Synthesis'
openreview: PZahJfBVNB
abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has recently seen significant progress thanks to
  large pretrained language models, large-scale training data, and the introduction
  of scalable model families such as diffusion and autoregressive models. However,
  the best-performing models require iterative evaluation to generate a single sample.
  In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) only need a single forward pass.
  They are thus much faster, but they currently remain far behind the state-of-the-art
  in large-scale text-to-image synthesis. This paper aims to identify the necessary
  steps to regain competitiveness. Our proposed model, StyleGAN-T, addresses the specific
  requirements of large-scale text-to-image synthesis, such as large capacity, stable
  training on diverse datasets, strong text alignment, and controllable variation
  vs. text alignment tradeoff. StyleGAN-T significantly improves over previous GANs
  and outperforms distilled diffusion models - the previous state-of-the-art in fast
  text-to-image synthesis - in terms of sample quality and speed.
