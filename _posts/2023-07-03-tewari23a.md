title: On the Estimation of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
openreview: uP5xXIULdH
abstract: This paper revisits Gaussian Mixture Copula Model (GMCM), a more expressive
  alternative to the widely used Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), with the goal to make
  its parameter estimation tractable. Both the Expectation Maximization and the direct
  Likelihood Maximization frameworks for GMCM have to grapple with a likelihood function
  that lacks a closed form. This has led to a few approximation schemes that alleviate
  the problem, nonetheless leaving the issue still unresolved. Additionally, past
  works have alluded to an additional challenge of parameter non-identifiability,
  but none has offered a rigorous treatment and a commensurate solution framework
  to overcome the same. This work offers solutions to each of these issues in an attempt
  to help GMCM realize its full potential. The source of non-identifiability is not
  only proven but also suitable priors are proposed that eliminate the problem. Additionally,
  an efficient numerical framework is proposed to evaluate the intractable likelihood
  function, while also providing its analytical derivatives. Finally, a view of GMCM
  as a series of bijective mappings from a base distribution is presented, which paves
  the way to synthesize GMCM using modern, probabilistic programming languages (PPLs).
  The main claims of this work are supported by empirical evidence gathered on synthetic
  and real-world datasets.
