title: Instrumental Variable Estimation of Average Partial Causal Effects
openreview: 68wSAeijsB
abstract: Instrumental variable (IV) analysis is a powerful tool widely used to elucidate
  causal relationships. We study the problem of estimating the average partial causal
  effect (APCE) of a continuous treatment in an IV setting. Specifically, we develop
  new methods for estimating APCE based on a recent identification condition via an
  integral equation. We develop two families of methods, nonparametric and parametric
  - the former uses the Picard iteration to solve the integral equation; the latter
  parameterizes APCE using a linear basis function model. We analyze the statistical
  and computational properties of the proposed methods and illustrate them on synthetic
  and real data.
