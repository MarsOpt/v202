title: Identifying Useful Learnwares for Heterogeneous Label Spaces
openreview: VOcPCpmEnZ
abstract: The learnware paradigm aims to build a learnware market containing numerous
  learnwares, each of which is a well-performing machine learning model with a corresponding
  specification to describe its functionality so that future users can identify useful
  models for reuse according to their own requirements. With the learnware paradigm,
  model developers can spontaneously submit models to the market without leaking data
  privacy, and users can leverage models in the market to accomplish different machine
  learning tasks without having to build models from scratch. Recent studies have
  attempted to realize the model specification through Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding
  (RKME). In this paper, we make an attempt to improve the effectiveness of RKME specification
  for heterogeneous label spaces, where the learnware market does not contain a model
  that has the same label space as the user’s task, by considering a class-specific
  model specification explicitly, along with a class-wise learnware identification
  method. Both theoretical and empirical analyses show that our proposal can quickly
  and accurately find useful learnwares that satisfy users’ requirements. Moreover,
  we find that for a specific task, reusing a small model identified via the specification
  performs better than directly reusing a pre-trained generic big model.
