title: On Second-Order Scoring Rules for Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification
openreview: MUC7ASJiBT
abstract: 'It is well known that accurate probabilistic predictors can be trained
  through empirical risk minimisation with proper scoring rules as loss functions.
  While such learners capture so-called aleatoric uncertainty of predictions, various
  machine learning methods have recently been developed with the goal to let the learner
  also represent its epistemic uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty caused by a lack
  of knowledge and data. An emerging branch of the literature proposes the use of
  a second-order learner that provides predictions in terms of distributions on probability
  distributions. However, recent work has revealed serious theoretical shortcomings
  for second-order predictors based on loss minimisation. In this paper, we generalise
  these findings and prove a more fundamental result: There seems to be no loss function
  that provides an incentive for a second-order learner to faithfully represent its
  epistemic uncertainty in the same manner as proper scoring rules do for standard
  (first-order) learners. As a main mathematical tool to prove this result, we introduce
  the generalised notion of second-order scoring rules.'
