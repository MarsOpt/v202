title: Individually Fair Learning with One-Sided Feedback
openreview: DOdfxTZLyq
abstract: 'We consider an online learning problem with one-sided feedback, in which
  the learner is able to observe the true label only for positively predicted instances.
  On each round, $k$ instances arrive and receive classification outcomes according
  to a randomized policy deployed by the learner, whose goal is to maximize accuracy
  while deploying individually fair policies. We first present a novel auditing scheme,
  capable of utilizing feedback from dynamically-selected panels of multiple, possibly
  inconsistent, auditors regarding fairness violations. In particular, we show how
  our proposed auditing scheme allows for algorithmically exploring the resulting
  accuracy-fairness frontier, with no need for additional feedback from auditors.
  We then present an efficient reduction from our problem of online learning with
  one-sided feedback and a panel reporting fairness violations to the contextual combinatorial
  semi-bandit problem (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2009; Gyorgy et al., 2007), allowing
  us to leverage algorithms for contextual combinatorial semi-bandits to establish
  multi-criteria no regret guarantees in our setting, simultaneously for accuracy
  and fairness. Our results eliminate two potential sources of bias from prior work:
  the “hidden outcomes” that are not available to an algorithm operating in the full
  information setting, and human biases that might be present in any single human
  auditor, but can be mitigated by selecting a well-chosen panel.'
