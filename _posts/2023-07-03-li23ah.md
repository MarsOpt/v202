title: 'Propensity Matters: Measuring and Enhancing Balancing for Recommendation'
openreview: m8gXFhK2ju
abstract: Propensity-based weighting methods have been widely studied and demonstrated
  competitive performance in debiased recommendations. Nevertheless, there are still
  many questions to be addressed. How to estimate the propensity more conducive to
  debiasing performance? Which metric is more reasonable to measure the quality of
  the learned propensities? Is it better to make the cross-entropy loss as small as
  possible when learning propensities? In this paper, we first discuss the potential
  problems of the previously widely adopted metrics for learned propensities, and
  propose balanced-mean-squared-error (BMSE) metric for debiased recommendations.
  Based on BMSE, we propose IPS-V2 and DR-V2 as the estimators of unbiased loss, and
  theoretically show that IPS-V2 and DR-V2 have greater propensity balancing and smaller
  variance without sacrificing additional bias. We further propose a co-training method
  for learning balanced representation and unbiased prediction. Extensive experiments
  are conducted on three real-world datasets including a large industrial dataset,
  and the results show that our approach boosts the balancing property and results
  in enhanced debiasing performance.
