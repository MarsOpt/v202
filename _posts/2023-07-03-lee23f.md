title: Exploring Chemical Space with Score-based Out-of-distribution Generation
openreview: WP07wAWxty
abstract: A well-known limitation of existing molecular generative models is that
  the generated molecules highly resemble those in the training set. To generate truly
  novel molecules that may have even better properties for de novo drug discovery,
  more powerful exploration in the chemical space is necessary. To this end, we propose
  Molecular Out-Of-distribution Diffusion(MOOD), a score-based diffusion scheme that
  incorporates out-of-distribution (OOD) control in the generative stochastic differential
  equation (SDE) with simple control of a hyperparameter, thus requires no additional
  costs. Since some novel molecules may not meet the basic requirements of real-world
  drugs, MOOD performs conditional generation by utilizing the gradients from a property
  predictor that guides the reverse-time diffusion process to high-scoring regions
  according to target properties such as protein-ligand interactions, drug-likeness,
  and synthesizability. This allows MOOD to search for novel and meaningful molecules
  rather than generating unseen yet trivial ones. We experimentally validate that
  MOOD is able to explore the chemical space beyond the training distribution, generating
  molecules that outscore ones found with existing methods, and even the top 0.01%
  of the original training pool. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeulLee05/MOOD.
