title: High-dimensional Clustering onto Hamiltonian Cycle
openreview: vwAjNGprym
abstract: Clustering aims to group unlabelled samples based on their similarities
  and is widespread in high-dimensional data analysis. However, most of the clustering
  methods merely generate pseudo labels and thus are unable to simultaneously present
  the similarities between different clusters and outliers. This paper proposes a
  new framework called High-dimensional Clustering onto Hamiltonian Cycle (HCHC) to
  solve the above problems. First, HCHC combines global structure with local structure
  in one objective function for deep clustering, improving the labels as relative
  probabilities, to mine the similarities between different clusters while keeping
  the local structure in each cluster. Then, the anchors of different clusters are
  sorted on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle generated by the cluster similarities and
  mapped on the circumference of a circle. Finally, a sample with a higher probability
  of a cluster will be mapped closer to the corresponding anchor. In this way, our
  framework allows us to appreciate three aspects visually and simultaneously - clusters
  (formed by samples with high probabilities), cluster similarities (represented as
  circular distances), and outliers (recognized as dots far away from all clusters).
  The theoretical analysis and experiments illustrate the superiority of HCHC.
