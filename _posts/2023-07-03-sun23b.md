title: 'MetaModulation: Learning Variational Feature Hierarchies for Few-Shot Learning
  with Fewer Tasks'
openreview: Sx5qQHvWWD
abstract: Meta-learning algorithms are able to learn a new task using previously learned
  knowledge, but they often require a large number of meta-training tasks which may
  not be readily available. To address this issue, we propose a method for few-shot
  learning with fewer tasks, which we call MetaModulation. The key idea is to use
  a neural network to increase the density of the meta-training tasks by modulating
  batch normalization parameters during meta-training. Additionally, we modify parameters
  at various neural network levels, rather than just a single layer, to increase task
  diversity. To account for the uncertainty caused by the reduced number of training
  tasks, we propose a variational MetaModulation where the modulation parameters are
  treated as latent variables. We also introduce learning variational feature hierarchies
  by the variational MetaModulation, which modulates features at all layers and can
  take into account task uncertainty and generate more diverse tasks. The ablation
  studies illustrate the advantages of utilizing a learnable task modulation at different
  levels and demonstrate the benefit of incorporating probabilistic variants in few-task
  meta-learning. Our MetaModulation and its variational variants consistently outperform
  state-of-the-art alternatives on four few-task meta-learning benchmarks.
