title: 'Multisample Flow Matching: Straightening Flows with Minibatch Couplings'
openreview: mxkGDxWOHS
abstract: Simulation-free methods for training continuous-time generative models construct
  probability paths that go between noise distributions and individual data samples.
  Recent works, such as Flow Matching, derived paths that are optimal for each data
  sample. However, these algorithms rely on independent data and noise samples, and
  do not exploit underlying structure in the data distribution for constructing probability
  paths. We propose Multisample Flow Matching, a more general framework that uses
  non-trivial couplings between data and noise samples while satisfying the correct
  marginal constraints. At small overhead costs, this generalization allows us to
  (i) reduce gradient variance during training, (ii) obtain straighter flows for the
  learned vector field, which allows us to generate high-quality samples using fewer
  function evaluations, and (iii) obtain transport maps with low cost in high dimensions,
  which has applications beyond generative modeling. Importantly, we do so in a completely
  simulation-free manner with a simple minimization objective. We show that our proposed
  methods improve sample consistency on downsampled ImageNet data sets, and lead to
  better low-cost sample generation.
