title: End-to-End Full-Atom Antibody Design
openreview: zAXusLf6R8
abstract: 'Antibody design is an essential yet challenging task in various domains
  like therapeutics and biology. There are two major defects in current learning-based
  methods: 1) tackling only a certain subtask of the whole antibody design pipeline,
  making them suboptimal or resource-intensive. 2) omitting either the framework regions
  or side chains, thus incapable of capturing the full-atom geometry. To address these
  pitfalls, we propose dynamic Multi-channel Equivariant grAph Network (dyMEAN), an
  end-to-end full-atom model for E(3)-equivariant antibody design given the epitope
  and the incomplete sequence of the antibody. Specifically, we first explore structural
  initialization as a knowledgeable guess of the antibody structure and then propose
  shadow paratope to bridge the epitope-antibody connections. Both 1D sequences and
  3D structures are updated via an adaptive multi-channel equivariant encoder that
  is able to process protein residues of variable sizes when considering full atoms.
  Finally, the updated antibody is docked to the epitope via the alignment of the
  shadow paratope. Experiments on epitope-binding CDR-H3 design, complex structure
  prediction, and affinity optimization demonstrate the superiority of our end-to-end
  framework and full-atom modeling.'
