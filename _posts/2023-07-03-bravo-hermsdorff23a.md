title: Quantifying Human Priors over Social and Navigation Networks
openreview: Z0yBZYQtIA
abstract: 'Human knowledge is largely implicit and relational â€” do we have a friend
  in common? can I walk from here to there? In this work, we leverage the combinatorial
  structure of graphs to quantify human priors over such relational data. Our experiments
  focus on two domains that have been continuously relevant over evolutionary timescales:
  social interaction and spatial navigation. We find that some features of the inferred
  priors are remarkably consistent, such as the tendency for sparsity as a function
  of graph size. Other features are domain-specific, such as the propensity for triadic
  closure in social interactions. More broadly, our work demonstrates how nonclassical
  statistical analysis of indirect behavioral experiments can be used to efficiently
  model latent biases in the data.'
