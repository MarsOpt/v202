title: Improving Medical Predictions by Irregular Multimodal Electronic Health Records
  Modeling
openreview: zi1iKanf9k
abstract: Health conditions among patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are monitored
  via electronic health records (EHRs), composed of numerical time series and lengthy
  clinical note sequences, both taken at $\textit{irregular}$ time intervals. Dealing
  with such irregularity in every modality, and integrating irregularity into multimodal
  representations to improve medical predictions, is a challenging problem. Our method
  first addresses irregularity in each single modality by (1) modeling irregular time
  series by dynamically incorporating hand-crafted imputation embeddings into learned
  interpolation embeddings via a gating mechanism, and (2) casting a series of clinical
  note representations as multivariate irregular time series and tackling irregularity
  via a time attention mechanism. We further integrate irregularity in multimodal
  fusion with an interleaved attention mechanism across temporal steps. To the best
  of our knowledge, this is the first work to thoroughly model irregularity in multimodalities
  for improving medical predictions. Our proposed methods for two medical prediction
  tasks consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in each single
  modality and multimodal fusion scenarios. Specifically, we observe relative improvements
  of 6.5%, 3.6%, and 4.3% in F1 for time series, clinical notes, and multimodal fusion,
  respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the
  importance of considering irregularity in multimodal EHRs.
