title: Large Language Models Struggle to Learn Long-Tail Knowledge
openreview: sfdKdeczaw
abstract: The Internet contains a wealth of knowledge—from the birthdays of historical
  figures to tutorials on how to code—all of which may be learned by language models.
  However, while certain pieces of information are ubiquitous on the web, others appear
  extremely rarely. In this paper, we study the relationship between the knowledge
  memorized by large language models and the information in pre-training datasets
  scraped from the web. In particular, we show that a language model’s ability to
  answer a fact-based question relates to how many documents associated with that
  question were seen during pre-training. We identify these relevant documents by
  entity linking pre-training datasets and counting documents that contain the same
  entities as a given question-answer pair. Our results demonstrate strong correlational
  and causal relationships between accuracy and relevant document count for numerous
  question answering datasets (e.g., TriviaQA), pre-training corpora (e.g., ROOTS),
  and model sizes (e.g., 176B parameters). Moreover, while larger models are better
  at learning long-tail knowledge, we estimate that today’s models must be scaled
  by many orders of magnitude to reach competitive QA performance on questions with
  little support in the pre-training data. Finally, we show that retrieval-augmentation
  can reduce the dependence on relevant pre-training information, presenting a promising
  approach for capturing the long-tail.
