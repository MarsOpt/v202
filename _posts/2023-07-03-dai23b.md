title: Refined Regret for Adversarial MDPs with Linear Function Approximation
openreview: 7WdMBofQFx
abstract: We consider learning in an adversarial Markov Decision Process (MDP) where
  the loss functions can change arbitrarily over $K$ episodes and the state space
  can be arbitrarily large. We assume that the Q-function of any policy is linear
  in some known features, that is, a linear function approximation exists. The best
  existing regret upper bound for this setting (Luo et al., 2021) is of order $\tilde{\mathcal
  O}(K^{2/3})$ (omitting all other dependencies), given access to a simulator. This
  paper provides two algorithms that improve the regret to $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt
  K)$ in the same setting. Our first algorithm makes use of a refined analysis of
  the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm with the log-barrier regularizer.
  This analysis allows the loss estimators to be arbitrarily negative and might be
  of independent interest. Our second algorithm develops a magnitude-reduced loss
  estimator, further removing the polynomial dependency on the number of actions in
  the first algorithm and leading to the optimal regret bound (up to logarithmic terms
  and dependency on the horizon). Moreover, we also extend the first algorithm to
  simulator-free linear MDPs, which achieves $\tilde{\mathcal O}(K^{8/9})$ regret
  and greatly improves over the best existing bound $\tilde{\mathcal O}(K^{14/15})$.
  This algorithm relies on a better alternative to the Matrix Geometric Resampling
  procedure by Neu & Olkhovskaya (2020), which could again be of independent interest.
