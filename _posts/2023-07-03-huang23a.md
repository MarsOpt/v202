title: Reinforcement Learning in Low-rank MDPs with Density Features
openreview: QWU4Q9pVlH
abstract: MDPs with low-rank transitions—that is, the transition matrix can be factored
  into the product of two matrices, left and right—is a highly representative structure
  that enables tractable learning. The left matrix enables expressive function approximation
  for value-based learning and has been studied extensively. In this work, we instead
  investigate sample-efficient learning with density features, i.e., the right matrix,
  which induce powerful models for state-occupancy distributions. This setting not
  only sheds light on leveraging unsupervised learning in RL, but also enables plug-in
  solutions for settings like convex RL. In the offline setting, we propose an algorithm
  for off-policy estimation of occupancies that can handle non-exploratory data. Using
  this as a subroutine, we further devise an online algorithm that constructs exploratory
  data distributions in a level-by-level manner. As a central technical challenge,
  the additive error of occupancy estimation is incompatible with the multiplicative
  definition of data coverage. In the absence of strong assumptions like reachability,
  this incompatibility easily leads to exponential error blow-up, which we overcome
  via novel technical tools. Our results also readily extend to the representation
  learning setting, when the density features are unknown and must be learned from
  an exponentially large candidate set.
