title: Mastering the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark from Pixels
openreview: eSpbTG0TZN
abstract: 'Controlling artificial agents from visual sensory data is an arduous task.
  Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can succeed but require large amounts of
  interactions between the agent and the environment. To alleviate the issue, unsupervised
  RL proposes to employ self-supervised interaction and learning, for adapting faster
  to future tasks. Yet, as shown in the Unsupervised RL Benchmark (URLB; Laskin et
  al. 2021), whether current unsupervised strategies can improve generalization capabilities
  is still unclear, especially in visual control settings. In this work, we study
  the URLB and propose a new method to solve it, using unsupervised model-based RL,
  for pre-training the agent, and a task-aware fine-tuning strategy combined with
  a new proposed hybrid planner, Dyna-MPC, to adapt the agent for downstream tasks.
  On URLB, our method obtains 93.59% overall normalized performance, surpassing previous
  baselines by a staggering margin. The approach is empirically evaluated through
  a large-scale empirical study, which we use to validate our design choices and analyze
  our models. We also show robust performance on the Real-Word RL benchmark, hinting
  at resiliency to environment perturbations during adaptation. Project website: https://masteringurlb.github.io/'
