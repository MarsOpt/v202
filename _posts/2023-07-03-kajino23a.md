title: Biases in Evaluation of Molecular Optimization Methods and Bias Reduction Strategies
openreview: lbsgD4Pkf0
abstract: We are interested in an evaluation methodology for molecular optimization.
  Given a sample of molecules and their properties of our interest, we wish not only
  to train a generator of molecules optimized with respect to a target property but
  also to evaluate its performance accurately. A common practice is to train a predictor
  of the target property using the sample and apply it to both training and evaluating
  the generator. However, little is known about its statistical properties, and thus,
  we are not certain about whether this performance estimate is reliable or not. We
  theoretically investigate this evaluation methodology and show that it potentially
  suffers from two biases; one is due to misspecification of the predictor and the
  other to reusing the same finite sample for training and evaluation. We discuss
  bias reduction methods for each of the biases, and empirically investigate their
  effectiveness.
