title: 'Dink-Net: Neural Clustering on Large Graphs'
openreview: T0eM9e8OUf
abstract: 'Deep graph clustering, which aims to group the nodes of a graph into disjoint
  clusters with deep neural networks, has achieved promising progress in recent years.
  However, the existing methods fail to scale to the large graph with million nodes.
  To solve this problem, a scalable deep graph clustering method (Dink-Net) is proposed
  with the idea of dilation and shrink. Firstly, by discriminating nodes, whether
  being corrupted by augmentations, representations are learned in a self-supervised
  manner. Meanwhile, the cluster centers are initialized as learnable neural parameters.
  Subsequently, the clustering distribution is optimized by minimizing the proposed
  cluster dilation loss and cluster shrink loss in an adversarial manner. By these
  settings, we unify the two-step clustering, i.e., representation learning and clustering
  optimization, into an end-to-end framework, guiding the network to learn clustering-friendly
  features. Besides, Dink-Net scales well to large graphs since the designed loss
  functions adopt the mini-batch data to optimize the clustering distribution even
  without performance drops. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate
  the superiority of our method. Compared to the runner-up, Dink-Net achieves $9.62%$
  NMI improvement on the ogbn-papers100M dataset with 111 million nodes and 1.6 billion
  edges. The source code is released: https://github.com/yueliu1999/Dink-Net. Besides,
  a collection (papers, codes, and datasets) of deep graph clustering is shared on
  GitHub https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Deep-Graph-Clustering.'
