title: Learning Deductive Reasoning from Synthetic Corpus based on Formal Logic
openreview: a6PvWIHFsF
abstract: We study a synthetic corpus based approach for language models (LMs) to
  acquire logical deductive reasoning ability. The previous studies generated deduction
  examples using specific sets of deduction rules. However, these rules were limited
  or otherwise arbitrary. This can limit the generalizability of acquired deductive
  reasoning ability. We rethink this and adopt a well-grounded set of deduction rules
  based on formal logic theory, which can derive any other deduction rules when combined
  in a multistep way. We empirically verify that LMs trained on the proposed corpora,
  which we name $\textbf{FLD}$ ($\textbf{F}$ormal $\textbf{L}$ogic $\textbf{D}$eduction),
  acquire more generalizable deductive reasoning ability. Furthermore, we identify
  the aspects of deductive reasoning ability on which deduction corpora can enhance
  LMs and those on which they cannot. Finally, on the basis of these results, we discuss
  the future directions for applying deduction corpora or other approaches for each
  aspect. We release the code, data, and models.
