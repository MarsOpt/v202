title: Online Learning in Stackelberg Games with an Omniscient Follower
openreview: QNz7DCibUS
abstract: We study the problem of online learning in a two-player decentralized cooperative
  Stackelberg game. In each round, the leader first takes an action, followed by the
  follower who takes their action after observing the leader’s move. The goal of the
  leader is to learn to minimize the cumulative regret based on the history of interactions.
  Differing from the traditional formulation of repeated Stackelberg games, we assume
  the follower is omniscient, with full knowledge of the true reward, and that they
  always best-respond to the leader’s actions. We analyze the sample complexity of
  regret minimization in this repeated Stackelberg game. We show that depending on
  the reward structure, the existence of the omniscient follower may change the sample
  complexity drastically, from constant to exponential, even for linear cooperative
  Stackelberg games. This poses unique challenges for the learning process of the
  leader and the subsequent regret analysis.
