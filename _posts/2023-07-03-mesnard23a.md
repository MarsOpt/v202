title: Quantile Credit Assignment
openreview: 4yoLVter71
abstract: In reinforcement learning, the credit assignment problem is to distinguish
  luck from skill, that is, separate the inherent randomness in the environment from
  the controllable effects of the agentâ€™s actions. This paper proposes two novel algorithms,
  Quantile Credit Assignment (QCA) and Hindsight QCA (HQCA), which incorporate distributional
  value estimation to perform credit assignment. QCA uses a network that predicts
  the quantiles of the return distribution, whereas HQCA additionally incorporates
  information about the future. Both QCA and HQCA have the appealing interpretation
  of leveraging an estimate of the quantile level of the return (interpreted as the
  level of "luck") in order to derive a "luck-dependent" baseline for policy gradient
  methods. We show theoretically that this approach gives an unbiased policy gradient
  estimate that can yield significant variance reductions over a standard value estimate
  baseline. QCA and HQCA significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art methods on
  a range of extremely difficult credit assignment problems.
