title: 'ClimaX: A foundation model for weather and climate'
openreview: TowCaiz7Ui
abstract: Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning aim to directly
  solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional
  mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated
  and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack
  the generality of currently used computationally intensive physics-informed numerical
  models for weather and climate modeling. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible
  and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be
  trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal
  coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with
  novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute
  and data while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pretrained with a self-supervised
  learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pretrained ClimaX
  can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including
  those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during
  pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality
  in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting
  and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.
