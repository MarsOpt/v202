title: Collaborative Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Multi-Armed Bandits
openreview: RUiWyj6fhN
abstract: The study of collaborative multi-agent bandits has attracted significant
  attention recently. In light of this, we initiate the study of a new collaborative
  setting, consisting of $N$ agents such that each agent is learning one of $M$ stochastic
  multi-armed bandits to minimize their group cumulative regret. We develop decentralized
  algorithms which facilitate collaboration between the agents under two scenarios.
  We characterize the performance of these algorithms by deriving the per agent cumulative
  regret and group regret upper bounds. We also prove lower bounds for the group regret
  in this setting, which demonstrates the near-optimal behavior of the proposed algorithms.
