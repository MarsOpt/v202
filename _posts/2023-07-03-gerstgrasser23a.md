title: 'Oracles & Followers: Stackelberg Equilibria in Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning'
openreview: IJffiJTLhI
abstract: Stackelberg equilibria arise naturally in a range of popular learning problems,
  such as in security games or indirect mechanism design, and have received increasing
  attention in the reinforcement learning literature. We present a general framework
  for implementing Stackelberg equilibria search as a multi-agent RL problem, allowing
  a wide range of algorithmic design choices. We discuss how previous approaches can
  be seen as specific instantiations of this framework. As a key insight, we note
  that the design space allows for approaches not previously seen in the literature,
  for instance by leveraging multitask and meta-RL techniques for follower convergence.
  We propose one such approach using contextual policies, and evaluate it experimentally
  on both standard and novel benchmark domains, showing greatly improved sample efficiency
  compared to previous approaches. Finally, we explore the effect of adopting algorithm
  designs outside the borders of our framework.
