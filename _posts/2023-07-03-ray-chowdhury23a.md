title: Beam Tree Recursive Cells
openreview: JK0hiktaFV
abstract: 'We propose Beam Tree Recursive Cell (BT-Cell) - a backpropagation-friendly
  framework to extend Recursive Neural Networks (RvNNs) with beam search for latent
  structure induction. We further extend this framework by proposing a relaxation
  of the hard top-$k$ operators in beam search for better propagation of gradient
  signals. We evaluate our proposed models in different out-of-distribution splits
  in both synthetic and realistic data. Our experiments show that BT-Cell achieves
  near-perfect performance on several challenging structure-sensitive synthetic tasks
  like ListOps and logical inference while maintaining comparable performance in realistic
  data against other RvNN-based models. Additionally, we identify a previously unknown
  failure case for neural models in generalization to unseen number of arguments in
  ListOps. The code is available at: https://github.com/JRC1995/BeamTreeRecursiveCells.'
