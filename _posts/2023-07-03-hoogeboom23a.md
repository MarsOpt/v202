title: 'simple diffusion: End-to-end diffusion for high resolution images'
openreview: 6l9YG3wHA9
abstract: 'Currently, applying diffusion models in pixel space of high resolution
  images is difficult. Instead, existing approaches focus on diffusion in lower dimensional
  spaces (latent diffusion), or have multiple super-resolution levels of generation
  referred to as cascades. The downside is that these approaches add additional complexity
  to the diffusion framework. This paper aims to improve denoising diffusion for high
  resolution images while keeping the model as simple as possible. The paper is centered
  around the research question: How can one train a standard denoising diffusion models
  on high resolution images, and still obtain performance comparable to these alternate
  approaches? The four main findings are: 1) the noise schedule should be adjusted
  for high resolution images, 2) It is sufficient to scale only a particular part
  of the architecture, 3) dropout should be added at specific locations in the architecture,
  and 4) downsampling is an effective strategy to avoid high resolution feature maps.
  Combining these simple yet effective techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art on
  image generation among diffusion models without sampling modifiers on ImageNet.'
