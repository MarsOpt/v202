title: Differentiable Tree Operations Promote Compositional Generalization
openreview: YZoYYaawO2
abstract: In the context of structure-to-structure transformation tasks, learning
  sequences of discrete symbolic operations poses significant challenges due to their
  non-differentiability. To facilitate the learning of these symbolic sequences, we
  introduce a differentiable tree interpreter that compiles high-level symbolic tree
  operations into subsymbolic matrix operations on tensors. We present a novel Differentiable
  Tree Machine (DTM) architecture that integrates our interpreter with an external
  memory and an agent that learns to sequentially select tree operations to execute
  the target transformation in an end-to-end manner. With respect to out-of-distribution
  compositional generalization on synthetic semantic parsing and language generation
  tasks, DTM achieves 100% while existing baselines such as Transformer, Tree Transformer,
  LSTM, and Tree2Tree LSTM achieve less than 30%. DTM remains highly interpretable
  in addition to its perfect performance.
