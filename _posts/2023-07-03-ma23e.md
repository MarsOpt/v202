title: Learning Intuitive Policies Using Action Features
openreview: 8OrM0aJbb2
abstract: An unaddressed challenge in multi-agent coordination is to enable AI agents
  to exploit the semantic relationships between the features of actions and the features
  of observations. Humans take advantage of these relationships in highly intuitive
  ways. For instance, in the absence of a shared language, we might point to the object
  we desire or hold up our fingers to indicate how many objects we want. To address
  this challenge, we investigate the effect of network architecture on the propensity
  of learning algorithms to exploit these semantic relationships. Across a procedurally
  generated coordination task, we find that attention-based architectures that jointly
  process a featurized representation of observations and actions have a better inductive
  bias for learning intuitive policies. Through fine-grained evaluation and scenario
  analysis, we show that the resulting policies are human-interpretable. Moreover,
  such agents coordinate with people without training on any human data.
