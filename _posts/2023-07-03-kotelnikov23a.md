title: 'TabDDPM: Modelling Tabular Data with Diffusion Models'
openreview: hTzPqLKBJY
abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are becoming the leading generative
  modeling paradigm for many important data modalities. Being the most prevalent in
  the computer vision community, diffusion models have recently gained some attention
  in other domains, including speech, NLP, and graph-like data. In this work, we investigate
  if the framework of diffusion models can be advantageous for general tabular problems,
  where data points are typically represented by vectors of heterogeneous features.
  The inherent heterogeneity of tabular data makes it quite challenging for accurate
  modeling since the individual features can be of a completely different nature,
  i.e., some of them can be continuous and some can be discrete. To address such data
  types, we introduce TabDDPM â€” a diffusion model that can be universally applied
  to any tabular dataset and handles any feature types. We extensively evaluate TabDDPM
  on a wide set of benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority over existing GAN/VAE
  alternatives, which is consistent with the advantage of diffusion models in other
  fields.
