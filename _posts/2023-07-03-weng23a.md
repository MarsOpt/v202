title: Towards Learning Geometric Eigen-Lengths Crucial for Fitting Tasks
openreview: mSslPmao9h
abstract: Some extremely low-dimensional yet crucial geometric eigen-lengths often
  determine the success of some geometric tasks. For example, the <em>height</em>
  of an object is important to measure to check if it can fit between the shelves
  of a cabinet, while the <em>width</em> of a couch is crucial when trying to move
  it through a doorway. Humans have materialized such crucial geometric eigen-lengths
  in common sense since they are very useful in serving as succinct yet effective,
  highly interpretable, and universal object representations. However, it remains
  obscure and underexplored if learning systems can be equipped with similar capabilities
  of automatically discovering such key geometric quantities from doing tasks. In
  this work, we therefore for the first time formulate and propose a novel learning
  problem on this question and set up a benchmark suite including tasks, data, and
  evaluation metrics for studying the problem. We focus on a family of common fitting
  tasks as the testbed for the proposed learning problem. We explore potential solutions
  and demonstrate the feasibility of learning eigen-lengths from simply observing
  successful and failed fitting trials. We also attempt geometric grounding for more
  accurate eigen-length measurement and study the reusability of the learned geometric
  eigen-lengths across multiple tasks. Our work marks the first exploratory step toward
  learning crucial geometric eigen-lengths and we hope it can inspire future research
  in tackling this important yet underexplored problem.
