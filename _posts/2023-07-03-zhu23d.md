title: Exploring Model Dynamics for Accumulative Poisoning Discovery
openreview: O6WR3dA0Hv
abstract: 'Adversarial poisoning attacks pose huge threats to various machine learning
  applications. Especially, the recent accumulative poisoning attacks show that it
  is possible to achieve irreparable harm on models via a sequence of imperceptible
  attacks followed by a trigger batch. Due to the limited data-level discrepancy in
  real-time data streaming, current defensive methods are indiscriminate in handling
  the poison and clean samples. In this paper, we dive into the perspective of model
  dynamics and propose a novel information measure, namely, Memorization Discrepancy,
  to explore the defense via the model-level information. By implicitly transferring
  the changes in the data manipulation to that in the model outputs, Memorization
  Discrepancy can discover the imperceptible poison samples based on their distinct
  dynamics from the clean samples. We thoroughly explore its properties and propose
  Discrepancy-aware Sample Correction (DSC) to defend against accumulative poisoning
  attacks. Extensive experiments comprehensively characterized Memorization Discrepancy
  and verified its effectiveness. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/Memorization-Discrepancy.'
