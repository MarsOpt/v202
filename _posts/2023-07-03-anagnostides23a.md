title: Near-Optimal $Φ$-Regret Learning in Extensive-Form Games
openreview: FK18BRc1vL
abstract: In this paper, we establish efficient and uncoupled learning dynamics so
  that, when employed by all players in multiplayer perfect-recall imperfect-information
  extensive-form games, the trigger regret of each player grows as $O(\log T)$ after
  $T$ repetitions of play. This improves exponentially over the prior best known trigger-regret
  bound of $O(T^{1/4})$, and settles a recent open question by Bai et al. (2022).
  As an immediate consequence, we guarantee convergence to the set of extensive-form
  correlated equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria at a near-optimal rate of
  $\frac{\log T}{T}$. Building on prior work, at the heart of our construction lies
  a more general result regarding fixed points deriving from rational functions with
  polynomial degree, a property that we establish for the fixed points of (coarse)
  trigger deviation functions. Moreover, our construction leverages a refined regret
  circuit for the convex hull, which—unlike prior guarantees—preserves the RVU property
  introduced by Syrgkanis et al. (NIPS, 2015); this observation has an independent
  interest in establishing near-optimal regret under learning dynamics based on a
  CFR-type decomposition of the regret.
