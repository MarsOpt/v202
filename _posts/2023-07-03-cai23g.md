title: Doubly Optimal No-Regret Learning in Monotone Games
openreview: Gd6iouUq1g
abstract: We consider online learning in multi-player smooth monotone games. Existing
  algorithms have limitations such as (1) being only applicable to strongly monotone
  games; (2) lacking the no-regret guarantee; (3) having only asymptotic or slow $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$
  last-iterate convergence rate to a Nash equilibrium. While the $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$
  rate is tight for a large class of algorithms including the well-studied extragradient
  algorithm and optimistic gradient algorithm, it is not optimal for all gradient-based
  algorithms. We propose the <em>accelerated optimistic gradient</em> (AOG) algorithm,
  the first doubly optimal no-regret learning algorithm for smooth monotone games.
  Namely, our algorithm achieves both (i) the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret
  in the adversarial setting under smooth and convex loss functions and (ii) the optimal
  $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ last-iterate convergence rate to a Nash equilibrium in
  multi-player smooth monotone games. As a byproduct of the accelerated last-iterate
  convergence rate, we further show that each player suffers only an $\mathcal{O}(\log
  T)$ individual <em>worst-case dynamic regret</em>, providing an exponential improvement
  over the previous state-of-the-art $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ bound.
