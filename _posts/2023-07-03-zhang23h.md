title: 'CataBEEM: Integrating Latent Interaction Categories in Node-wise Community
  Detection Models for Network Data'
openreview: JcNKs5pE8J
abstract: Community detection is a fundamental task in network analysis. Learning
  underlying network structures has brought deep insights into the understanding of
  complex systems. While many methods have focused on clustering nodes into blocks,
  few accounts for the fact that interactions may exhibit edge-level clustering, which
  we call categories. Real network data often arise via a series of interactions.
  Interactions in complex systems can often be clustered into different categories
  and node-level community structures that depend on the category. In this paper,
  we introduce a category-and-block edge exchangeable model (CataBEEM) to study interaction
  networks with joint latent interaction-level category and node-level community structures.
  In particular, the proposed method models the network from the interaction process
  perspective and allows the incorporation of prior knowledge from auxiliary interaction-wise
  information. We derive an efficient variational inference algorithm that can be
  applied to networks consisting of millions of interactions and provide the theoretical
  bound of the misspecification rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
  in various simulation settings and apply the method to TalkLife data, a large-scale
  online peer-to-peer support network. We show CataBEEM detects more temporally consistent
  community structures and has better predictions than other methods.
