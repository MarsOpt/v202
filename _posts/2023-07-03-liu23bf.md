title: Contextual Combinatorial Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms
openreview: c8DEV8h93W
abstract: We study contextual combinatorial bandits with probabilistically triggered
  arms (C$^2$MAB-T) under a variety of smoothness conditions that capture a wide range
  of applications, such as contextual cascading bandits and contextual influence maximization
  bandits. Under the triggering probability modulated (TPM) condition, we devise the
  C$^2$-UCB-T algorithm and propose a novel analysis that achieves an $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{KT})$
  regret bound, removing a potentially exponentially large factor $O(1/p_{\min})$,
  where $d$ is the dimension of contexts, $p_{\min}$ is the minimum positive probability
  that any arm can be triggered, and batch-size $K$ is the maximum number of arms
  that can be triggered per round. Under the variance modulated (VM) or triggering
  probability and variance modulated (TPVM) conditions, we propose a new variance-adaptive
  algorithm VAC$^2$-UCB and derive a regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$, which is
  independent of the batch-size $K$. As a valuable by-product, our analysis technique
  and variance-adaptive algorithm can be applied to the CMAB-T and C$^2$MAB setting,
  improving existing results there as well. We also include experiments that demonstrate
  the improved performance of our algorithms compared with benchmark algorithms on
  synthetic and real-world datasets.
