title: 'MAHALO: Unifying Offline Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning from
  Observations'
openreview: khats8j30c
abstract: 'We study a new paradigm for sequential decision making, called offline
  policy learning from observations (PLfO). Offline PLfO aims to learn policies using
  datasets with substandard qualities: 1) only a subset of trajectories is labeled
  with rewards, 2) labeled trajectories may not contain actions, 3) labeled trajectories
  may not be of high quality, and 4) the data may not have full coverage. Such imperfection
  is common in real-world learning scenarios, and offline PLfO encompasses many existing
  offline learning setups, including offline imitation learning (IL), offline IL from
  observations (ILfO), and offline reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we present
  a generic approach to offline PLfO, called Modality-agnostic Adversarial Hypothesis
  Adaptation for Learning from Observations (MAHALO). Built upon the pessimism concept
  in offline RL, MAHALO optimizes the policy using a performance lower bound that
  accounts for uncertainty due to the datasetâ€™s insufficient coverage. We implement
  this idea by adversarially training data-consistent critic and reward functions,
  which forces the learned policy to be robust to data deficiency. We show that MAHALO
  consistently outperforms or matches specialized algorithms across a variety of offline
  PLfO tasks in theory and experiments. Our code is available at https://github.com/AnqiLi/mahalo.'
