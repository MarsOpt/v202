title: Exact Inference in High-order Structured Prediction
openreview: VaDX94whmE
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of inference in high-order structured
  prediction tasks. In the context of Markov random fields, the goal of a high-order
  inference task is to maximize a score function on the space of labels, and the score
  function can be decomposed into sum of unary and high-order potentials. We apply
  a generative model approach to study the problem of high-order inference, and provide
  a two-stage convex optimization algorithm for exact label recovery. We also provide
  a new class of hypergraph structural properties related to hyperedge expansion that
  drives the success in general high-order inference problems. Finally, we connect
  the performance of our algorithm and the hyperedge expansion property using a novel
  hypergraph Cheeger-type inequality.
