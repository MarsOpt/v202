title: 'Rethinking Visual Reconstruction: Experience-Based Content Completion Guided
  by Visual Cues'
openreview: l3sdNQdmQh
abstract: Decoding seen images from brain activities has been an absorbing field.
  However, the reconstructed images still suffer from low quality with existing studies.
  This can be because our visual system is not like a camera that ”remembers” every
  pixel. Instead, only part of the information can be perceived with our selective
  attention, and the brain ”guesses” the rest to form what we think we see. Most existing
  approaches ignored the brain completion mechanism. In this work, we propose to reconstruct
  seen images with both the visual perception and the brain completion process, and
  design a simple, yet effective visual decoding framework to achieve this goal. Specifically,
  we first construct a shared discrete representation space for both brain signals
  and images. Then, a novel self-supervised token-to-token inpainting network is designed
  to implement visual content completion by building context and prior knowledge about
  the visual objects from the discrete latent space. Our approach improved the quality
  of visual reconstruction significantly and achieved state-of-the-art.
