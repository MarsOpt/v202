title: Demystifying Disagreement-on-the-Line in High Dimensions
openreview: VAa3ncgG1I
abstract: Evaluating the performance of machine learning models under distribution
  shifts is challenging, especially when we only have unlabeled data from the shifted
  (target) domain, along with labeled data from the original (source) domain. Recent
  work suggests that the notion of <em>disagreement</em>, the degree to which two
  models trained with different randomness differ on the same input, is a key to tackling
  this problem. Experimentally, disagreement and prediction error have been shown
  to be strongly connected, which has been used to estimate model performance. Experiments
  have led to the discovery of the <em>disagreement-on-the-line</em> phenomenon, whereby
  the classification error under the target domain is often a linear function of the
  classification error under the source domain; and whenever this property holds,
  disagreement under the source and target domain follow the same linear relation.
  In this work, we develop a theoretical foundation for analyzing disagreement in
  high-dimensional random features regression; and study under what conditions the
  disagreement-on-the-line phenomenon occurs in our setting. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,
  Tiny ImageNet-C, and Camelyon17 are consistent with our theory and support the universality
  of the theoretical findings.
