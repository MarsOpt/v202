title: 'Maximum Optimality Margin: A Unified Approach for Contextual Linear Programming
  and Inverse Linear Programming'
openreview: 4JmgYXoBNd
abstract: In this paper, we study the predict-then-optimize problem where the output
  of a machine learning prediction task is used as the input of some downstream optimization
  problem, say, the objective coefficient vector of a linear program. The problem
  is also known as predictive analytics or contextual linear programming. The existing
  approaches largely suffer from either (i) optimization intractability (a non-convex
  objective function)/statistical inefficiency (a suboptimal generalization bound)
  or (ii) requiring strong condition(s) such as no constraint or loss calibration.
  We develop a new approach to the problem called maximum optimality margin which
  designs the machine learning loss function by the optimality condition of the downstream
  optimization. The max-margin formulation enjoys both computational efficiency and
  good theoretical properties for the learning procedure. More importantly, our new
  approach only needs the observations of the optimal solution in the training data
  rather than the objective function, which makes it a new and natural approach to
  the inverse linear programming problem under both contextual and context-free settings;
  we also analyze the proposed method under both offline and online settings, and
  demonstrate its performance using numerical experiments.
