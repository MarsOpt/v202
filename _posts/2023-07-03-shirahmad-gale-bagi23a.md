title: Generative Causal Representation Learning for Out-of-Distribution Motion Forecasting
openreview: Kw90j2pNSt
abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods typically assume i.i.d samples
  and are found to be sensitive to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We propose Generative
  Causal Representation Learning (GCRL) which leverages causality to facilitate knowledge
  transfer under distribution shifts. While we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
  method in human trajectory prediction models, GCRL can be applied to other domains
  as well. First, we propose a novel causal model that explains the generative factors
  in motion forecasting datasets using features that are common across all environments
  and with features that are specific to each environment. Selection variables are
  used to determine which parts of the model can be directly transferred to a new
  environment without fine-tuning. Second, we propose an end-to-end variational learning
  paradigm to learn the causal mechanisms that generate observations from features.
  GCRL is supported by strong theoretical results that imply identifiability of the
  causal model under certain assumptions. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world
  motion forecasting datasets show the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed
  method for knowledge transfer under zero-shot and low-shot settings by substantially
  outperforming the prior motion forecasting models on out-of-distribution prediction.
