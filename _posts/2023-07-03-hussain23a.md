title: The Impact of Exploration on Convergence and Performance of Multi-Agent Q-Learning
  Dynamics
openreview: agPrVQdnxT
abstract: Understanding the impact of exploration on the behaviour of multi-agent
  learning has, so far, benefited from the restriction to potential, or network zero-sum
  games in which convergence to an equilibrium can be shown. Outside of these classes,
  learning dynamics rarely converge and little is known about the effect of exploration
  in the face of non-convergence. To progress this front, we study the smooth Q- Learning
  dynamics. We show that, in any network game, exploration by agents results in the
  convergence of Q-Learning to a neighbourhood of an equilibrium. This holds independently
  of whether the dynamics reach the equilibrium or display complex behaviours. We
  show that increasing the exploration rate decreases the size of this neighbourhood
  and also decreases the ability of all agents to improve their payoffs. Furthermore,
  in a broad class of games, the payoff performance of Q-Learning dynamics, measured
  by Social Welfare, decreases when the exploration rate increases. Our experiments
  show this to be a general phenomenon, namely that exploration leads to improved
  convergence of Q-Learning, at the cost of payoff performance.
