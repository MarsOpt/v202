title: A theory of representation learning gives a deep generalisation of kernel methods
openreview: Jrc3VDPMt0
abstract: The successes of modern deep machine learning methods are founded on their
  ability to transform inputs across multiple layers to build good high-level representations.
  It is therefore critical to understand this process of representation learning.
  However, standard theoretical approaches (formally NNGPs) involving infinite width
  limits eliminate representation learning. We therefore develop a new infinite width
  limit, the Bayesian representation learning limit, that exhibits representation
  learning mirroring that in finite-width models, yet at the same time, retains some
  of the simplicity of standard infinite-width limits. In particular, we show that
  Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) in the Bayesian representation learning limit have
  exactly multivariate Gaussian posteriors, and the posterior covariances can be obtained
  by optimizing an interpretable objective combining a log-likelihood to improve performance
  with a series of KL-divergences which keep the posteriors close to the prior. We
  confirm these results experimentally in wide but finite DGPs. Next, we introduce
  the possibility of using this limit and objective as a flexible, deep generalisation
  of kernel methods, that we call deep kernel machines (DKMs). Like most naive kernel
  methods, DKMs scale cubically in the number of datapoints. We therefore use methods
  from the Gaussian process inducing point literature to develop a sparse DKM that
  scales linearly in the number of datapoints. Finally, we extend these approaches
  to NNs (which have non-Gaussian posteriors) in the Appendices.
