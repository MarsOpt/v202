title: Evidential Interactive Learning for Medical Image Captioning
openreview: 6wfqx3CdKv
abstract: 'Medical image captioning alleviates the burden of physicians and possibly
  reduces medical errors by automatically generating text descriptions to describe
  image contents and convey findings. It is more challenging than conventional image
  captioning due to the complexity of medical images and the difficulty of aligning
  image regions with medical terms. In this paper, we propose an evidential interactive
  learning framework that leverages evidence-based uncertainty estimation and interactive
  machine learning to improve image captioning with limited labeled data. The interactive
  learning process involves three stages: keyword prediction, caption generation,
  and model retraining. First, the model predicts a list of keywords with evidence-based
  uncertainty and selects the most informative keywords to seek user feedback. Second,
  user-approved keywords are used as model input to guide the model to generate satisfactory
  captions. Third, the model is updated based on user-approved keywords and captions,
  where evidence-based uncertainty is used to allocate different weights to different
  data instances. Experiments on two medical image datasets illustrate that the proposed
  framework can effectively learn from human feedback and improve the modelâ€™s performance
  in the future.'
