title: Margin-based Neural Network Watermarking
openreview: bwBeCyuFZh
abstract: As Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms become prevalent, deep
  neural network (DNN) watermarking techniques are gaining increasing attention, which
  enables one to verify the ownership of a target DNN model in a black-box scenario.
  Unfortunately, previous watermarking methods are vulnerable to functionality stealing
  attacks, thus allowing an adversary to falsely claim the ownership of a DNN model
  stolen from its original owner. In this work, we propose a novel margin-based DNN
  watermarking approach that is robust to the functionality stealing attacks based
  on model extraction and distillation. Specifically, during training, our method
  maximizes the margins of watermarked samples by using projected gradient ascent
  on them so that their predicted labels cannot change without compromising the accuracy
  of the model that the attacker tries to steal. We validate our method on multiple
  benchmarks and show that our watermarking method successfully defends against model
  extraction attacks, outperforming recent baselines.
