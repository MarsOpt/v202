title: Patch-level Contrastive Learning via Positional Query for Visual Pre-training
openreview: Si9pBgOGeD
abstract: Dense contrastive learning (DCL) has been recently explored for learning
  localized information for dense prediction tasks (e.g., detection and segmentation).
  It still suffers the difficulty of mining pixels/patches correspondence between
  two views. A simple way is inputting the same view twice and aligning the pixel/patch
  representation. However, it would reduce the variance of inputs, and hurts the performance.
  We propose a plug-in method PQCL (Positional Query for patch-level Contrastive Learning),
  which allows performing patch-level contrasts between two views with exact patch
  correspondence. Besides, by using positional queries, PQCL increases the variance
  of inputs, to enhance training. We apply PQCL to popular transformer-based CL frameworks
  (DINO and iBOT, and evaluate them on classification, detection and segmentation
  tasks, where our method obtains stable improvements, especially for dense tasks.
  It achieves new state-of-the-art in most settings. Code is available at https://github.com/Sherrylone/Query_Contrastive.
