title: Theoretical Behavior of XAI Methods in the Presence of Suppressor Variables
openreview: BdwGV6fwbK
abstract: In recent years, the community of ’explainable artificial intelligence’
  (XAI) has created a vast body of methods to bridge a perceived gap between model
  ’complexity’ and ’interpretability’. However, a concrete problem to be solved by
  XAI methods has not yet been formally stated. As a result, XAI methods are lacking
  theoretical and empirical evidence for the ’correctness’ of their explanations,
  limiting their potential use for quality-control and transparency purposes. At the
  same time, Haufe et al. (2014) showed, using simple toy examples, that even standard
  interpretations of linear models can be highly misleading. Specifically, high importance
  may be attributed to so-called suppressor variables lacking any statistical relation
  to the prediction target. This behavior has been confirmed empirically for a large
  array of XAI methods in Wilming et al. (2022). Here, we go one step further by deriving
  analytical expressions for the behavior of a variety of popular XAI methods on a
  simple two-dimensional binary classification problem involving Gaussian class-conditional
  distributions. We show that the majority of the studied approaches will attribute
  non-zero importance to a non-class-related suppressor feature in the presence of
  correlated noise. This poses important limitations on the interpretations and conclusions
  that the outputs of these XAI methods can afford.
