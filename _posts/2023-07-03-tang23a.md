title: Auto-Differentiation of Relational Computations for Very Large Scale Machine
  Learning
openreview: CRmRAuwfd4
abstract: The relational data model was designed to facilitate large-scale data management
  and analytics. We consider the problem of how to differentiate computations expressed
  relationally. We show experimentally that a relational engine running an auto-differentiated
  relational algorithm can easily scale to very large datasets, and is competitive
  with state-of-the-art, special-purpose systems for large-scale distributed machine
  learning.
