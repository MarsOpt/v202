title: Generating Language Corrections for Teaching Physical Control Tasks
openreview: cd97d9zV0s
abstract: AI assistance continues to help advance applications in education, from
  language learning to intelligent tutoring systems, yet current methods for providing
  students feedback are still quite limited. Most automatic feedback systems either
  provide binary correctness feedback, which may not help a student understand how
  to improve, or require hand-coding feedback templates, which may not generalize
  to new domains. This can be particularly challenging for physical control tasks,
  where the rich diversity in student behavior and specialized domains make it challenging
  to leverage general-purpose assistive tools for providing feedback. We design and
  build CORGI, a model trained to generate language corrections for physical control
  tasks, such as learning to ride a bike. CORGI takes in as input a pair of student
  and expert trajectories, and then generates natural language corrections to help
  the student improve. We collect and train CORGI over data from three diverse physical
  control tasks (drawing, steering, and joint movement). Through both automatic and
  human evaluations, we show that CORGI can (i) generate valid feedback for novel
  student trajectories, (ii) outperform baselines on domains with novel control dynamics,
  and (iii) improve student learning in an interactive drawing task.
