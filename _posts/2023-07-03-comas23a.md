title: Inferring Relational Potentials in Interacting Systems
openreview: Iwt7oI9cNb
abstract: 'Systems consisting of interacting agents are prevalent in the world, ranging
  from dynamical systems in physics to complex biological networks. To build systems
  which can interact robustly in the real world, it is thus important to be able to
  infer the precise interactions governing such systems. Existing approaches typically
  discover such interactions by explicitly modeling the feed-forward dynamics of the
  trajectories. In this work, we propose Neural Interaction Inference with Potentials
  (NIIP) as an alternative approach to discover such interactions that enables greater
  flexibility in trajectory modeling: it discovers a set of relational potentials,
  represented as energy functions, which when minimized reconstruct the original trajectory.
  NIIP assigns low energy to the subset of trajectories which respect the relational
  constraints observed. We illustrate that with these representations NIIP displays
  unique capabilities in test-time. First, it allows trajectory manipulation, such
  as interchanging interaction types across separately trained models, as well as
  trajectory forecasting. Additionally, it allows adding external hand-crafted potentials
  at test-time. Finally, NIIP enables the detection of out-of-distribution samples
  and anomalies without explicit training.'
