title: 'Performative Recommendation: Diversifying Content via Strategic Incentives'
openreview: k24luy3Azi
abstract: The primary goal in recommendation is to suggest relevant content to users,
  but optimizing for accuracy often results in recommendations that lack diversity.
  To remedy this, conventional approaches such as re-ranking improve diversity by
  <em>presenting</em> more diverse items. Here we argue that to promote inherent and
  prolonged diversity, the system must encourage its <em>creation</em>. Towards this,
  we harness the performative nature of recommendation, and show how learning can
  incentivize strategic content creators to create diverse content. Our approach relies
  on a novel form of regularization that anticipates strategic changes to content,
  and penalizes for content homogeneity. We provide analytic and empirical results
  that demonstrate when and how diversity can be incentivized, and experimentally
  demonstrate the utility of our approach on synthetic and semi-synthetic data.
