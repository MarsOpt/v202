title: Symmetry-Aware Robot Design with Structured Subgroups
openreview: jeHP6aBCBu
abstract: Robot design aims at learning to create robots that can be easily controlled
  and perform tasks efficiently. Previous works on robot design have proven its ability
  to generate robots for various tasks. However, these works searched the robots directly
  from the vast design space and ignored common structures, resulting in abnormal
  robots and poor performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a Symmetry-Aware
  Robot Design (SARD) framework that exploits the structure of the design space by
  incorporating symmetry searching into the robot design process. Specifically, we
  represent symmetries with the subgroups of the dihedral group and search for the
  optimal symmetry in structured subgroups. Then robots are designed under the searched
  symmetry. In this way, SARD can design efficient symmetric robots while covering
  the original design space, which is theoretically analyzed. We further empirically
  evaluate SARD on various tasks, and the results show its superior efficiency and
  generalizability.
