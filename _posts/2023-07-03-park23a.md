title: Kernel Sufficient Dimension Reduction and Variable Selection for Compositional
  Data via Amalgamation
openreview: Q6Y1cnHMee
abstract: Compositional data with a large number of components and an abundance of
  zeros are frequently observed in many fields recently. Analyzing such sparse high-dimensional
  compositional data naturally calls for dimension reduction or, more preferably,
  variable selection. Most existing approaches lack interpretability or cannot handle
  zeros properly, as they rely on a log-ratio transformation. We approach this problem
  with sufficient dimension reduction (SDR), one of the most studied dimension reduction
  frameworks in statistics. Characterized by the conditional independence of the data
  to the response on the found subspace, the SDR framework has been effective for
  both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction problems. This work proposes a compositional
  SDR that can handle zeros naturally while incorporating the nonlinear nature and
  spurious negative correlations among components rigorously. A critical consideration
  of sub-composition versus amalgamation for compositional variable selection is discussed.
  The proposed compositional SDR is shown to be statistically consistent in constructing
  a sub-simplex consisting of true signal variables. Simulation and real microbiome
  data are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed SDR compared to existing
  state-of-art approaches.
