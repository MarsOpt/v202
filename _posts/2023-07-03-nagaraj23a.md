title: Multi-User Reinforcement Learning with Low Rank Rewards
openreview: 06djx2x2Rf
abstract: 'We consider collaborative multi-user reinforcement learning, where multiple
  users have the same state-action space and transition probabilities but different
  rewards. Under the assumption that the reward matrix of the $N$ users has a low-rank
  structure – a standard and practically successful assumption in the collaborative
  filtering setting – we design algorithms with significantly lower sample complexity
  compared to the ones that learn the MDP individually for each user. Our main contribution
  is an algorithm which explores rewards collaboratively with $N$ user-specific MDPs
  and can learn rewards efficiently in two key settings: tabular MDPs and linear MDPs.
  When $N$ is large and the rank is constant, the sample complexity per MDP depends
  logarithmically over the size of the state-space, which represents an exponential
  reduction (in the state-space size) when compared to the standard “non-collaborative”
  algorithms. Our main technical contribution is a method to construct policies which
  obtain data such that low rank matrix completion is possible (without a generative
  model). This goes beyond the regular RL framework and is closely related to mean
  field limits of multi-agent RL.'
