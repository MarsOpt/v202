title: Effective and Efficient Structural Inference with Reservoir Computing
openreview: BVvYe8q9CF
abstract: In this paper, we present an effective and efficient structural inference
  approach by integrating a Reservoir Computing (RC) network into a Variational Auto-encoder-based
  (VAE-based) structural inference framework. With the help of Bi-level Optimization,
  the backbone VAE-based method follows the Information Bottleneck principle and infers
  a general adjacency matrix in its latent space; the RC net substitutes the partial
  role of the decoder and encourages the whole approach to perform further steps of
  gradient descent based on limited available data. The experimental results on various
  datasets including biological networks, simulated fMRI data, and physical simulations
  show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method for structural inference,
  either with much fewer trajectories or with much shorter trajectories compared with
  previous works.
