title: Human-Timescale Adaptation in an Open-Ended Task Space
openreview: thUjOwfzzv
abstract: 'Foundation models have shown impressive adaptation and scalability in supervised
  and self-supervised learning problems, but so far these successes have not fully
  translated to reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we demonstrate that training
  an RL agent at scale leads to a general in-context learning algorithm that can adapt
  to open-ended novel embodied 3D problems as quickly as humans. In a vast space of
  held-out environment dynamics, our adaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven
  exploration, efficient exploitation of acquired knowledge, and can successfully
  be prompted with first-person demonstrations. Adaptation emerges from three ingredients:
  (1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and diverse task distribution,
  (2) a policy parameterised as a large-scale attention-based memory architecture,
  and (3) an effective automated curriculum that prioritises tasks at the frontier
  of an agent’s capabilities. We demonstrate characteristic scaling laws with respect
  to network size, memory length, and richness of the training task distribution.
  We believe our results lay the foundation for increasingly general and adaptive
  RL agents that perform well across ever-larger open-ended domains.'
