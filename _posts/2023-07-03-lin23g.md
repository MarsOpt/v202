title: Accelerated Cyclic Coordinate Dual Averaging with Extrapolation for Composite
  Convex Optimization
openreview: 6hQ0jDq5gj
abstract: Exploiting partial first-order information in a cyclic way is arguably the
  most natural strategy to obtain scalable first-order methods. However, despite their
  wide use in practice, cyclic schemes are far less understood from a theoretical
  perspective than their randomized counterparts. Motivated by a recent success in
  analyzing an extrapolated cyclic scheme for generalized variational inequalities,
  we propose an <em>Accelerated Cyclic Coordinate Dual Averaging with Extrapolation</em>
  (A-CODER) method for composite convex optimization, where the objective function
  can be expressed as the sum of a smooth convex function accessible via a gradient
  oracle and a convex, possibly nonsmooth, function accessible via a proximal oracle.
  We show that A-CODER attains the optimal convergence rate with improved dependence
  on the number of blocks compared to prior work. Furthermore, for the setting where
  the smooth component of the objective function is expressible in a finite sum form,
  we introduce a variance-reduced variant of A-CODER, VR-A-CODER, with state-of-the-art
  complexity guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms
  through numerical experiments.
