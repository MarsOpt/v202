title: Answering Complex Logical Queries on Knowledge Graphs via Query Computation
  Tree Optimization
openreview: KTJ6E8t9Cy
abstract: Answering complex logical queries on incomplete knowledge graphs is a challenging
  task, and has been widely studied. Embedding-based methods require training on complex
  queries and may not generalize well to out-of-distribution query structures. Recent
  work frames this task as an end-to-end optimization problem, and it only requires
  a pretrained link predictor. However, due to the exponentially large combinatorial
  search space, the optimal solution can only be approximated, limiting the final
  accuracy. In this work, we propose QTO (Query Computation Tree Optimization) that
  can efficiently find the exact optimal solution. QTO finds the optimal solution
  by a forward-backward propagation on the tree-like computation graph, i.e., query
  computation tree. In particular, QTO utilizes the independence encoded in the query
  computation tree to reduce the search space, where only local computations are involved
  during the optimization procedure. Experiments on 3 datasets show that QTO obtains
  state-of-the-art performance on complex query answering, outperforming previous
  best results by an average of 22%. Moreover, QTO can interpret the intermediate
  solutions for each of the one-hop atoms in the query with over 90% accuracy.
