title: Online Mechanism Design for Information Acquisition
openreview: egNzERK8s3
abstract: We study the problem of designing mechanisms for information acquisition
  scenarios. This setting models strategic interactions between a uniformed receiver
  and a set of informed senders. In our model the senders receive information about
  the underlying state of nature and communicate their observation (either truthfully
  or not) to the receiver, which, based on this information, selects an action. Our
  goal is to design mechanisms maximizing the receiverâ€™s utility while incentivizing
  the senders to report truthfully their information. First, we provide an algorithm
  that efficiently computes an optimal incentive compatible (IC) mechanism. Then,
  we focus on the online problem in which the receiver sequentially interacts in an
  unknown game, with the objective of minimizing the cumulative regret w.r.t. the
  optimal IC mechanism, and the cumulative violation of the incentive compatibility
  constraints. We investigate two different online scenarios, i.e., the full and bandit
  feedback settings. For the full feedback problem, we propose an algorithm that guarantees
  $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and violation, while for the bandit feedback setting
  we present an algorithm that attains $\tilde{O}(T^{\alpha})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\alpha/2})$
  violation for any $\alpha \in [1/2, 1]$. Finally, we complement our results providing
  a tight lower bound.
