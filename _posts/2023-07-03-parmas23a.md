title: Model-based Reinforcement Learning with Scalable Composite Policy Gradient
  Estimators
openreview: rDMAJECBM2
abstract: In model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), policy gradients can be estimated
  either by derivative-free RL methods, such as likelihood ratio gradients (LR), or
  by backpropagating through a differentiable model via reparameterization gradients
  (RP). Instead of using one or the other, the Total Propagation (TP) algorithm in
  prior work showed that a combination of LR and RP estimators averaged using inverse
  variance weighting (IVW) can achieve orders of magnitude improvement over either
  method. However, IVW-based composite estimators have not yet been applied in modern
  RL tasks, as it is unclear if they can be implemented scalably. We propose a scalable
  method, Total Propagation X (TPX) that improves over TP by changing the node used
  for IVW, and employing coordinate wise weighting. We demonstrate the scalability
  of TPX by applying it to the state of the art visual MBRL algorithm Dreamer. The
  experiments showed that Dreamer fails with long simulation horizons, while our TPX
  works reliably for only a fraction of additional computation. One key advantage
  of TPX is its ease of implementation, which will enable experimenting with IVW on
  many tasks beyond MBRL.
