title: 'FAENet: Frame Averaging Equivariant GNN for Materials Modeling'
openreview: HRDRZNxQXc
abstract: 'Applications of machine learning techniques for materials modeling typically
  involve functions that are known to be equivariant or invariant to specific symmetries.
  While graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven successful in such applications,
  conventional GNN approaches that enforce symmetries via the model architecture often
  reduce expressivity, scalability or comprehensibility. In this paper, we introduce
  (1) a flexible, model-agnostic framework based on stochastic frame averaging that
  enforces E(3) equivariance or invariance, without any architectural constraints;
  (2) FAENet: a simple, fast and expressive GNN that leverages stochastic frame averaging
  to process geometric information without constraints. We prove the validity of our
  method theoretically and demonstrate its superior accuracy and computational scalability
  in materials modeling on the OC20 dataset (S2EF, IS2RE) as well as common molecular
  modeling tasks (QM9, QM7-X).'
