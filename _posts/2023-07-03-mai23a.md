title: 'CSP: Self-Supervised Contrastive Spatial Pre-Training for Geospatial-Visual
  Representations'
openreview: R3WrLjtzG8
abstract: Geo-tagged images are publicly available in large quantities, whereas labels
  such as object classes are rather scarce and expensive to collect. Meanwhile, contrastive
  learning has achieved tremendous success in various natural image and language tasks
  with limited labeled data. However, existing methods fail to fully leverage geospatial
  information, which can be paramount to distinguishing objects that are visually
  similar. To directly leverage the abundant geospatial information associated with
  images in pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference stages, we present Contrastive
  Spatial Pre-Training (CSP), a self-supervised learning framework for geo-tagged
  images. We use a dual-encoder to separately encode the images and their corresponding
  geo-locations, and use contrastive objectives to learn effective location representations
  from images, which can be transferred to downstream supervised tasks such as image
  classification. Experiments show that CSP can improve model performance on both
  iNat2018 and fMoW datasets. Especially, on iNat2018, CSP significantly boosts the
  model performance with 10-34% relative improvement with various labeled training
  data sampling ratios.
