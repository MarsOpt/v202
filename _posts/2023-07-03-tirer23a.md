title: Perturbation Analysis of Neural Collapse
openreview: HFATn6FFcG
abstract: 'Training deep neural networks for classification often includes minimizing
  the training loss beyond the zero training error point. In this phase of training,
  a "neural collapse" behavior has been observed: the variability of features (outputs
  of the penultimate layer) of within-class samples decreases and the mean features
  of different classes approach a certain tight frame structure. Recent works analyze
  this behavior via idealized unconstrained features models where all the minimizers
  exhibit exact collapse. However, with practical networks and datasets, the features
  typically do not reach exact collapse, e.g., because deep layers cannot arbitrarily
  modify intermediate features that are far from being collapsed. In this paper, we
  propose a richer model that can capture this phenomenon by forcing the features
  to stay in the vicinity of a predefined features matrix (e.g., intermediate features).
  We explore the model in the small vicinity case via perturbation analysis and establish
  results that cannot be obtained by the previously studied models. For example, we
  prove reduction in the within-class variability of the optimized features compared
  to the predefined input features (via analyzing gradient flow on the "central-path"
  with minimal assumptions), analyze the minimizers in the near-collapse regime, and
  provide insights on the effect of regularization hyperparameters on the closeness
  to collapse. We support our theory with experiments in practical deep learning settings.'
