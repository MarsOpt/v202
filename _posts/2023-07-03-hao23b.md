title: Coupled Variational Autoencoder
openreview: V1YbiqUsMi
abstract: Variational auto-encoders are powerful probabilistic models in generative
  tasks but suffer from generating low-quality samples which are caused by the holes
  in the prior. We propose the Coupled Variational Auto-Encoder (C-VAE), which formulates
  the VAE problem as one of Optimal Transport (OT) between the prior and data distributions.
  The C-VAE allows greater flexibility in priors and natural resolution of the prior
  hole problem by enforcing coupling between the prior and the data distribution and
  enables flexible optimization through the primal, dual, and semi-dual formulations
  of entropic OT. Simulations on synthetic and real data show that the C-VAE outperforms
  alternatives including VAE, WAE, and InfoVAE in fidelity to the data, quality of
  the latent representation, and in quality of generated samples.
