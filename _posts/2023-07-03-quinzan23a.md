title: 'DRCFS: Doubly Robust Causal Feature Selection'
openreview: JrSWhb7dzp
abstract: Knowing the features of a complex system that are highly relevant to a particular
  target variable is of fundamental interest in many areas of science. Existing approaches
  are often limited to linear settings, sometimes lack guarantees, and in most cases,
  do not scale to the problem at hand, in particular to images. We propose DRCFS,
  a doubly robust feature selection method for identifying the causal features even
  in nonlinear and high dimensional settings. We provide theoretical guarantees, illustrate
  necessary conditions for our assumptions, and perform extensive experiments across
  a wide range of simulated and semi-synthetic datasets. DRCFS significantly outperforms
  existing state-of-the-art methods, selecting robust features even in challenging
  highly non-linear and high-dimensional problems.
