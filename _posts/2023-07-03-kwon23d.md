title: Complexity of Block Coordinate Descent with Proximal Regularization and Applications
  to Wasserstein CP-dictionary Learning
openreview: riwzTUhBkj
abstract: We consider the block coordinate descent methods of Gauss-Seidel type with
  proximal regularization (BCD-PR), which is a classical method of minimizing general
  nonconvex objectives under constraints that has a wide range of practical applications.
  We theoretically establish the worst-case complexity bound for this algorithm. Namely,
  we show that for general nonconvex smooth objectives with block-wise constraints,
  the classical BCD-PR algorithm converges to an epsilon-stationary point within O(1/epsilon)
  iterations. Under a mild condition, this result still holds even if the algorithm
  is executed inexactly in each step. As an application, we propose a provable and
  efficient algorithm for ‘Wasserstein CP-dictionary learning’, which seeks a set
  of elementary probability distributions that can well-approximate a given set of
  d-dimensional joint probability distributions. Our algorithm is a version of BCD-PR
  that operates in the dual space, where the primal problem is regularized both entropically
  and proximally.
