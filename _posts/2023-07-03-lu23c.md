title: 'STEP: Learning N:M Structured Sparsity Masks from Scratch with Precondition'
openreview: 0O7b2Y198V
abstract: 'Recent innovations on hardware (e.g. Nvidia A100) have motivated learning
  N:M structured sparsity masks from scratch for fast model inference. However, state-of-the-art
  learning recipes in this regime (e.g. SR-STE) are proposed for non-adaptive optimizers
  like momentum SGD, while incurring non-trivial accuracy drop for Adam-trained models
  like attention-based LLMs. In this paper, we first demonstrate such gap origins
  from poorly estimated second moment (i.e. variance) in Adam states given by the
  masked weights. We conjecture that learning N:M masks with Adam should take the
  critical regime of variance estimation into account. In light of this, we propose
  STEP, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates
  a reliable variance estimate (<em>precondition phase</em>) and subsequently, the
  variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N:M masks (<em>mask-learning
  phase</em>). STEP automatically identifies the switching point of two phases by
  dynamically sampling variance changes over the training trajectory and testing the
  sample concentration. Empirically, we evaluate STEP and other baselines such as
  ASP and SR-STE on multiple tasks including CIFAR classification, machine translation
  and LLM fine-tuning (BERT-Base, GPT-2). We show STEP mitigates the accuracy drop
  of baseline recipes and is robust to aggressive structured sparsity ratios.'
