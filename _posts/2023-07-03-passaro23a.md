title: Reducing SO(3) Convolutions to SO(2) for Efficient Equivariant GNNs
openreview: QIejMwU0r9
abstract: Graph neural networks that model 3D data, such as point clouds or atoms,
  are typically desired to be $SO(3)$ equivariant, i.e., equivariant to 3D rotations.
  Unfortunately equivariant convolutions, which are a fundamental operation for equivariant
  networks, increase significantly in computational complexity as higher-order tensors
  are used. In this paper, we address this issue by reducing the $SO(3)$ convolutions
  or tensor products to mathematically equivalent convolutions in $SO(2)$ . This is
  accomplished by aligning the node embeddingsâ€™ primary axis with the edge vectors,
  which sparsifies the tensor product and reduces the computational complexity from
  $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^3)$, where $L$ is the degree of the representation. We demonstrate
  the potential implications of this improvement by proposing the Equivariant Spherical
  Channel Network (eSCN), a graph neural network utilizing our novel approach to equivariant
  convolutions, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale OC-20 and
  OC-22 datasets.
