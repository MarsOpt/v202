title: 'Invariant Slot Attention: Object Discovery with Slot-Centric Reference Frames'
openreview: ZXeTCRZJp9
abstract: Automatically discovering composable abstractions from raw perceptual data
  is a long-standing challenge in machine learning. Recent slot-based neural networks
  that learn about objects in a self-supervised manner have made exciting progress
  in this direction. However, they typically fall short at adequately capturing spatial
  symmetries present in the visual world, which leads to sample inefficiency, such
  as when entangling object appearance and pose. In this paper, we present a simple
  yet highly effective method for incorporating spatial symmetries via slot-centric
  reference frames. We incorporate equivariance to per-object pose transformations
  into the attention and generation mechanism of Slot Attention by translating, scaling,
  and rotating position encodings. These changes result in little computational overhead,
  are easy to implement, and can result in large gains in terms of data efficiency
  and overall improvements to object discovery. We evaluate our method on a wide range
  of synthetic object discovery benchmarks namely CLEVR, Tetrominoes, CLEVRTex, Objects
  Room and MultiShapeNet, and show promising improvements on the challenging real-world
  Waymo Open dataset.
