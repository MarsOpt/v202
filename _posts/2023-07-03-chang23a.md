title: Memory-Based Dual Gaussian Processes for Sequential Learning
openreview: UxQsrlM6mY
abstract: Sequential learning with Gaussian processes (GPs) is challenging when access
  to past data is limited, for example, in continual and active learning. In such
  cases, errors can accumulate over time due to inaccuracies in the posterior, hyperparameters,
  and inducing points, making accurate learning challenging. Here, we present a method
  to keep all such errors in check using the recently proposed dual sparse variational
  GP. Our method enables accurate inference for generic likelihoods and improves learning
  by actively building and updating a memory of past data. We demonstrate its effectiveness
  in several applications involving Bayesian optimization, active learning, and continual
  learning.
