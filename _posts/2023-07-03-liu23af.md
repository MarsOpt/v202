title: Simple Embodied Language Learning as a Byproduct of Meta-Reinforcement Learning
openreview: OUicoKgvtc
abstract: 'Whereas machine learning models typically learn language by directly training
  on language tasks (e.g., next-word prediction), language emerges in human children
  as a byproduct of solving non-language tasks (e.g., acquiring food). Motivated by
  this observation, we ask: can embodied reinforcement learning (RL) agents also indirectly
  learn language from non-language tasks? Learning to associate language with its
  meaning requires a dynamic environment with varied language. Therefore, we investigate
  this question in a multi-task environment with language that varies across the different
  tasks. Specifically, we design an office navigation environment, where the agent’s
  goal is to find a particular office, and office locations differ in different buildings
  (i.e., tasks). Each building includes a floor plan with a simple language description
  of the goal office’s location, which can be visually read as an RGB image when visited.
  We find RL agents indeed are able to indirectly learn language. Agents trained with
  current meta-RL algorithms successfully generalize to reading floor plans with held-out
  layouts and language phrases, and quickly navigate to the correct office, despite
  receiving no direct language supervision.'
