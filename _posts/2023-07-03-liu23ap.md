title: Taxonomy-Structured Domain Adaptation
openreview: ybl9lzdZw7
abstract: Domain adaptation aims to mitigate distribution shifts among different domains.
  However, traditional formulations are mostly limited to categorical domains, greatly
  simplifying nuanced domain relationships in the real world. In this work, we tackle
  a generalization with taxonomy-structured domains, which formalizes domains with
  nested, hierarchical similarity structures such as animal species and product catalogs.
  We build on the classic adversarial framework and introduce a novel <em>taxonomist</em>,
  which competes with the adversarial discriminator to preserve the taxonomy information.
  The equilibrium recovers the classic adversarial domain adaptationâ€™s solution if
  given a non-informative domain taxonomy (e.g., a flat taxonomy where all leaf nodes
  connect to the root node) while yielding non-trivial results with other taxonomies.
  Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets with successful adaptation.
