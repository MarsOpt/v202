title: Variational Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Unsupervised Discovery of
  Skills
openreview: U4r9JNyNZ7
abstract: Mutual information-based reinforcement learning (RL) has been proposed as
  a promising framework for retrieving complex skills autonomously without a task-oriented
  reward function through mutual information (MI) maximization or variational empowerment.
  However, learning complex skills is still challenging, due to the fact that the
  order of training skills can largely affect sample efficiency. Inspired by this,
  we recast variational empowerment as curriculum learning in goal-conditioned RL
  with an intrinsic reward function, which we name Variational Curriculum RL (VCRL).
  From this perspective, we propose a novel approach to unsupervised skill discovery
  based on information theory, called Value Uncertainty Variational Curriculum (VUVC).
  We prove that, under regularity conditions, VUVC accelerates the increase of entropy
  in the visited states compared to the uniform curriculum. We validate the effectiveness
  of our approach on complex navigation and robotic manipulation tasks in terms of
  sample efficiency and state coverage speed. We also demonstrate that the skills
  discovered by our method successfully complete a real-world robot navigation task
  in a zero-shot setup and that incorporating these skills with a global planner further
  increases the performance.
