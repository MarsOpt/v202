title: 'MultiAdam: Parameter-wise Scale-invariant Optimizer for Multiscale Training
  of Physics-informed Neural Networks'
openreview: mernbGTe24
abstract: Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently achieved remarkable
  progress in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in various fields by minimizing
  a weighted sum of PDE loss and boundary loss. However, there are several critical
  challenges in the training of PINNs, including the lack of theoretical frameworks
  and the imbalance between PDE loss and boundary loss. In this paper, we present
  an analysis of second-order non-homogeneous PDEs, which are classified into three
  categories and applicable to various common problems. We also characterize the connections
  between the training loss and actual error, guaranteeing convergence under mild
  conditions. The theoretical analysis inspires us to further propose MultiAdam, a
  scale-invariant optimizer that leverages gradient momentum to parameter-wisely balance
  the loss terms. Extensive experiment results on multiple problems from different
  physical domains demonstrate that our MultiAdam solver can improve the predictive
  accuracy by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared with strong baselines.
