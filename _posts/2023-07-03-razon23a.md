title: Automated Search for Conjectures on Mathematical Constants using Analysis of
  Integer Sequences
openreview: s8LWZVJb0f
abstract: 'The discovery of formulas involving mathematical constants such as $\pi$
  and $e$ had a great impact on various fields of science and mathematics. However,
  such discoveries have remained scarce, relying on the intuition of mathematicians
  such as Ramanujan and Gauss. Recent efforts to automate such discoveries, such as
  the Ramanujan Machine project, relied solely on exhaustive search and remain limited
  by the space of options that can be covered. Here we propose a fundamentally different
  method to search for conjectures on mathematical constants: through analysis of
  integer sequences. We introduce the Enumerated Signed-continued-fraction Massey
  Approve (ESMA) algorithm, which builds on the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm to identify
  patterns in integer sequences that represent mathematical constants. ESMA has found
  various known formulas and new conjectures for $e, e^2, \tan(1)$, and ratios of
  values of Bessel functions, many of which provide faster numerical convergence than
  their corresponding simple continued fractions forms. We also characterize the space
  of constants that ESMA can catch and quantify its algorithmic advantage in certain
  scenarios. Altogether, this work continues the development toward algorithm-augmented
  mathematical intuition, to help accelerate mathematical research.'
