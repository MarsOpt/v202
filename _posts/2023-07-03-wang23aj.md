title: 'GEAR: A GPU-Centric Experience Replay System for Large Reinforcement Learning
  Models'
openreview: elL6uw9qOX
abstract: This paper introduces a distributed, GPU-centric experience replay system,
  GEAR, designed to perform scalable reinforcement learning (RL) with large sequence
  models (such as transformers). With such models, existing systems such as Reverb
  face considerable bottlenecks in memory, computation, and communication. GEAR, however,
  optimizes memory efficiency by enabling the memory resources on GPU servers (including
  host memory and device memory) to manage trajectory data. Furthermore, it facilitates
  decentralized GPU devices to expedite various trajectory selection strategies, circumventing
  computational bottlenecks. GEAR is equipped with GPU kernels capable of collecting
  trajectories using zero-copy access to host memory, along with remote-directed-memory
  access over InfiniBand, improving communication efficiency. Cluster experiments
  have shown that GEAR can achieve performance levels up to 6Ã— greater than Reverb
  when training state-of-the-art large RL models. GEAR is open-sourced at https://
  github.com/bigrl-team/gear.
