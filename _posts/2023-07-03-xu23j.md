title: Diverse and Faithful Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation via Sequential
  Posterior Inference
openreview: 6eGltW7t8F
abstract: The capability to generate responses with diversity and faithfulness using
  factual knowledge is paramount for creating a human-like, trustworthy dialogue system.
  Common strategies either adopt a two-step paradigm, which optimizes knowledge selection
  and response generation separately, and may overlook the inherent correlation between
  these two tasks, or leverage conditional variational method to jointly optimize
  knowledge selection and response generation by employing an inference network. In
  this paper, we present an end-to-end learning framework, termed Sequential Posterior
  Inference (SPI), capable of selecting knowledge and generating dialogues by approximately
  sampling from the posterior distribution. Unlike other methods, SPI does not require
  the inference network or assume a simple geometry of the posterior distribution.
  This straightforward and intuitive inference procedure of SPI directly queries the
  response generation model, allowing for accurate knowledge selection and generation
  of faithful responses. In addition to modeling contributions, our experimental results
  on two common dialogue datasets (Wizard of Wikipedia and Holl-E) demonstrate that
  SPI outperforms previous strong baselines according to both automatic and human
  evaluation metrics.
