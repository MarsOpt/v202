title: 'Action Matching: Learning Stochastic Dynamics from Samples'
openreview: E3BW8pG64Y
abstract: Learning the continuous dynamics of a system from snapshots of its temporal
  marginals is a problem which appears throughout natural sciences and machine learning,
  including in quantum systems, single-cell biological data, and generative modeling.
  In these settings, we assume access to cross-sectional samples that are uncorrelated
  over time, rather than full trajectories of samples. In order to better understand
  the systems under observation, we would like to learn a model of the underlying
  process that allows us to propagate samples in time and thereby simulate entire
  individual trajectories. In this work, we propose Action Matching, a method for
  learning a rich family of dynamics using only independent samples from its time
  evolution. We derive a tractable training objective, which does not rely on explicit
  assumptions about the underlying dynamics and does not require back-propagation
  through differential equations or optimal transport solvers. Inspired by connections
  with optimal transport, we derive extensions of Action Matching to learn stochastic
  differential equations and dynamics involving creation and destruction of probability
  mass. Finally, we showcase applications of Action Matching by achieving competitive
  performance in a diverse set of experiments from biology, physics, and generative
  modeling.
