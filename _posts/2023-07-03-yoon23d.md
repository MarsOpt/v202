title: Graph Generative Model for Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks
openreview: SpA7YFu02k
abstract: As the field of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) continues to grow, it experiences
  a corresponding increase in the need for large, real-world datasets to train and
  test new GNN models on challenging, realistic problems. Unfortunately, such graph
  datasets are often generated from online, highly privacy-restricted ecosystems,
  which makes research and development on these datasets hard, if not impossible.
  This greatly reduces the amount of benchmark graphs available to researchers, causing
  the field to rely only on a handful of publicly-available datasets. To address this
  problem, we introduce a novel graph generative model, Computation Graph Transformer
  (CGT) that learns and reproduces the distribution of real-world graphs in a privacy-controlled
  way. More specifically, CGT (1) generates effective benchmark graphs on which GNNs
  show similar task performance as on the source graphs, (2) scales to process large-scale
  graphs, (3) incorporates off-the-shelf privacy modules to guarantee end-user privacy
  of the generated graph. Extensive experiments across a vast body of graph generative
  models show that only our model can successfully generate privacy-controlled, synthetic
  substitutes of large-scale real-world graphs that can be effectively used to benchmark
  GNN models.
