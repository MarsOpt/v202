title: 'Everyone’s Preference Changes Differently: A Weighted Multi-Interest Model
  For Retrieval'
openreview: MYer35ydij
abstract: User embeddings (vectorized representations of a user) are essential in
  recommendation systems. Numerous approaches have been proposed to construct a representation
  for the user in order to find similar items for retrieval tasks, and they have been
  proven effective in industrial recommendation systems. Recently people have discovered
  the power of using multiple embeddings to represent a user, with the hope that each
  embedding represents the user’s interest in a certain topic. With multi-interest
  representation, it’s important to model the user’s preference over the different
  topics and how the preference changes with time. However, existing approaches either
  fail to estimate the user’s affinity to each interest or unreasonably assume every
  interest of every user fades at an equal rate with time, thus hurting the performance
  of candidate retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Interest Preference
  (MIP) model, an approach that not only produces multi-interest for users by using
  the user’s sequential engagement more effectively but also automatically learns
  a set of weights to represent the preference over each embedding so that the candidates
  can be retrieved from each interest proportionally. Extensive experiments have been
  done on various industrial-scale datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach.
