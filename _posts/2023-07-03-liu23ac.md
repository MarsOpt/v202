title: 'Lazy Agents: A New Perspective on Solving Sparse Reward Problem in Multi-agent
  Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: DRu5BlRqrn
abstract: Sparse reward remains a valuable and challenging problem in multi-agent
  reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses this issue from a new perspective,
  i.e., lazy agents. We empirically illustrate how lazy agents damage learning from
  both exploration and exploitation. Then, we propose a novel MARL framework called
  Lazy Agents Avoidance through Influencing External States (LAIES). Firstly, we examine
  the causes and types of lazy agents in MARL using a causal graph of the interaction
  between agents and their environment. Then, we mathematically define the concept
  of fully lazy agents and teams by calculating the causal effect of their actions
  on external states using the do-calculus process. Based on definitions, we provide
  two intrinsic rewards to motivate agents, i.e., individual diligence intrinsic motivation
  (IDI) and collaborative diligence intrinsic motivation (CDI). IDI and CDI employ
  counterfactual reasoning based on the external states transition model (ESTM) we
  developed. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on various tasks, including the sparse-reward version of StarCraft multi-agent
  challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF). Our code is open-source and
  available at https://github.com/liuboyin/LAIES.
