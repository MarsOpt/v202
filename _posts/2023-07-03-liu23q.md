title: Online Local Differential Private Quantile Inference via Self-normalization
openreview: 8tEBexODhm
abstract: Based on binary inquiries, we developed an algorithm to estimate population
  quantiles under Local Differential Privacy (LDP). By self-normalizing, our algorithm
  provides asymptotically normal estimation with valid inference, resulting in tight
  confidence intervals without the need for nuisance parameters to be estimated. Our
  proposed method can be conducted fully online, leading to high computational efficiency
  and minimal storage requirements with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ space. We also proved an
  optimality result by an elegant application of one central limit theorem of Gaussian
  Differential Privacy (GDP) when targeting the frequently encountered median estimation
  problem. With mathematical proof and extensive numerical testing, we demonstrate
  the validity of our algorithm both theoretically and experimentally.
