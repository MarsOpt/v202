title: Computationally Efficient PAC RL in POMDPs with Latent Determinism and Conditional
  Embeddings
openreview: TPQbXPohiz
abstract: We study reinforcement learning with function approximation for large-scale
  Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) where the state space and
  observation space are large or even continuous. Particularly, we consider Hilbert
  space embeddings of POMDP where the feature of latent states and the feature of
  observations admit a conditional Hilbert space embedding of the observation emission
  process, and the latent state transition is deterministic. Under the function approximation
  setup where the optimal latent state-action $Q$-function is linear in the state
  feature, and the optimal $Q$-function has a gap in actions, we provide a computationally
  and statistically efficient algorithm for finding the exact optimal policy. We show
  our algorithmâ€™s computational and statistical complexities scale polynomially with
  respect to the horizon and the intrinsic dimension of the feature on the observation
  space. Furthermore, we show both the deterministic latent transitions and gap assumptions
  are necessary to avoid statistical complexity exponential in horizon or dimension.
  Since our guarantee does not have an explicit dependence on the size of the state
  and observation spaces, our algorithm provably scales to large-scale POMDPs.
