title: Deterministic equivalent and error universality of deep random features learning
openreview: BurklMMas2
abstract: This manuscript considers the problem of learning a random Gaussian network
  function using a fully connected network with frozen intermediate layers and trainable
  readout layer. This problem can be seen as a natural generalization of the widely
  studied random features model to deeper architectures. First, we prove Gaussian
  universality of the test error in a ridge regression setting where the learner and
  target networks share the same intermediate layers, and provide a sharp asymptotic
  formula for it. Establishing this result requires proving a deterministic equivalent
  for traces of the deep random features sample covariance matrices which can be of
  independent interest. Second, we conjecture the asymptotic Gaussian universality
  of the test error in the more general setting of arbitrary convex losses and generic
  learner/target architectures. We provide extensive numerical evidence for this conjecture,
  which requires the derivation of closed-form expressions for the layer-wise post-activation
  population covariances. In light of our results, we investigate the interplay between
  architecture design and implicit regularization.
