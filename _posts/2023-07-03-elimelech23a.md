title: Phase Transitions in the Detection of Correlated Databases
openreview: 0NsrPtxeou
abstract: 'We study the problem of detecting the correlation between two Gaussian
  databases $\mathsf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and $\mathsf{Y}^{n\times d}$, each
  composed of $n$ users with $d$ features. This problem is relevant in the analysis
  of social media, computational biology, etc. We formulate this as a hypothesis testing
  problem: under the null hypothesis, these two databases are statistically independent.
  Under the alternative, however, there exists an unknown permutation $\sigma$ over
  the set of $n$ users (or, row permutation), such that $\mathsf{X}$ is $\rho$-correlated
  with $\mathsf{Y}^\sigma$, a permuted version of $\mathsf{Y}$. We determine sharp
  thresholds at which optimal testing exhibits a phase transition, depending on the
  asymptotic regime of $n$ and $d$. Specifically, we prove that if $\rho^2d\to0$,
  as $d\to\infty$, then weak detection (performing slightly better than random guessing)
  is statistically impossible, <em>irrespectively</em> of the value of $n$. This compliments
  the performance of a simple test that thresholds the sum all entries of $\mathsf{X}^T\mathsf{Y}$.
  Furthermore, when $d$ is fixed, we prove that strong detection (vanishing error
  probability) is impossible for any $\rho<\rho^\star$, where $\rho^\star$ is an explicit
  function of $d$, while weak detection is again impossible as long as $\rho^2d=o(1)$,
  as $n\to\infty$. These results close significant gaps in current recent related
  studies.'
