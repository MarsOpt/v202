title: Multi-task Hierarchical Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning
openreview: RBikc9cIZh
abstract: Multi-task Imitation Learning (MIL) aims to train a policy capable of performing
  a distribution of tasks based on multi-task expert demonstrations, which is essential
  for general-purpose robots. Existing MIL algorithms suffer from low data efficiency
  and poor performance on complex long-horizontal tasks. We develop Multi-task Hierarchical
  Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MH-AIRL) to learn hierarchically-structured
  multi-task policies, which is more beneficial for compositional tasks with long
  horizons and has higher expert data efficiency through identifying and transferring
  reusable basic skills across tasks. To realize this, MH-AIRL effectively synthesizes
  context-based multi-task learning, AIRL (an IL approach), and hierarchical policy
  learning. Further, MH-AIRL can be adopted to demonstrations without the task or
  skill annotations (i.e., state-action pairs only) which are more accessible in practice.
  Theoretical justifications are provided for each module of MH-AIRL, and evaluations
  on challenging multi-task settings demonstrate superior performance and transferability
  of the multi-task policies learned with MH-AIRL as compared to SOTA MIL baselines.
