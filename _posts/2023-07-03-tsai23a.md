title: Representer Point Selection for Explaining Regularized High-dimensional Models
openreview: GLI2hX4vxx
abstract: 'We introduce a novel class of sample-based explanations we term <em>high-dimensional
  representers</em>, that can be used to explain the predictions of a regularized
  high-dimensional model in terms of importance weights for each of the training samples.
  Our workhorse is a novel representer theorem for general regularized high-dimensional
  models, which decomposes the model prediction in terms of contributions from each
  of the training samples: with positive (negative) values corresponding to positive
  (negative) impact training samples to the modelâ€™s prediction. We derive consequences
  for the canonical instances of $\ell_1$ regularized sparse models and nuclear norm
  regularized low-rank models. As a case study, we further investigate the application
  of low-rank models in the context of collaborative filtering, where we instantiate
  high-dimensional representers for specific popular classes of models. Finally, we
  study the empirical performance of our proposed methods on three real-world binary
  classification datasets and two recommender system datasets. We also showcase the
  utility of high-dimensional representers in explaining model recommendations.'
