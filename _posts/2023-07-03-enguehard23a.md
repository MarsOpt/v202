title: Learning Perturbations to Explain Time Series Predictions
openreview: WpeZu6WzTB
abstract: Explaining predictions based on multivariate time series data carries the
  additional difficulty of handling not only multiple features, but also time dependencies.
  It matters not only what happened, but also when, and the same feature could have
  a very different impact on a prediction depending on this time information. Previous
  work has used perturbation-based saliency methods to tackle this issue, perturbing
  an input using a trainable mask to discover which features at which times are driving
  the predictions. However these methods introduce fixed perturbations, inspired from
  similar methods on static data, while there seems to be little motivation to do
  so on temporal data. In this work, we aim to explain predictions by learning not
  only masks, but also associated perturbations. We empirically show that learning
  these perturbations significantly improves the quality of these explanations on
  time series data.
