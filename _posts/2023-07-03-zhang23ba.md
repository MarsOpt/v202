title: Unlocking Slot Attention by Changing Optimal Transport Costs
openreview: FMomWFNh5d
abstract: 'Slot attention is a powerful method for object-centric modeling in images
  and videos. However, its set-equivariance limits its ability to handle videos with
  a dynamic number of objects because it cannot break ties. To overcome this limitation,
  we first establish a connection between slot attention and optimal transport. Based
  on this new perspective we propose <b>MESH</b> (Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn): a
  cross-attention module that combines the tiebreaking properties of unregularized
  optimal transport with the speed of regularized optimal transport. We evaluate slot
  attention using MESH on multiple object-centric learning benchmarks and find significant
  improvements over slot attention in every setting.'
