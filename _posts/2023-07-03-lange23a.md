title: 'Lottery Tickets in Evolutionary Optimization: On Sparse Backpropagation-Free
  Trainability'
openreview: Lq5H6B6yug
abstract: Is the lottery ticket phenomenon an idiosyncrasy of gradient-based training
  or does it generalize to evolutionary optimization? In this paper we establish the
  existence of highly sparse trainable initializations for evolution strategies (ES)
  and characterize qualitative differences compared to gradient descent (GD)-based
  sparse training. We introduce a novel signal-to-noise iterative pruning procedure,
  which incorporates loss curvature information into the network pruning step. This
  can enable the discovery of even sparser trainable network initializations when
  using black-box evolution as compared to GD-based optimization. Furthermore, we
  find that these initializations encode an inductive bias, which transfers across
  different ES, related tasks and even to GD-based training. Finally, we compare the
  local optima resulting from the different optimization paradigms and sparsity levels.
  In contrast to GD, ES explore diverse and flat local optima and do not preserve
  linear mode connectivity across sparsity levels and independent runs. The results
  highlight qualitative differences between evolution and gradient-based learning
  dynamics, which can be uncovered by the study of iterative pruning procedures.
