title: Modeling Dynamic Environments with Scene Graph Memory
openreview: NiUxS1cAI4
abstract: 'Embodied AI agents that search for objects in large environments such as
  households often need to make efficient decisions by predicting object locations
  based on partial information. We pose this as a new type of link prediction problem:
  link prediction on partially observable dynamic graphs Our graph is a representation
  of a scene in which rooms and objects are nodes, and their relationships are encoded
  in the edges; only parts of the changing graph are known to the agent at each timestep.
  This partial observability poses a challenge to existing link prediction approaches,
  which we address. We propose a novel state representation – Scene Graph Memory (SGM)
  – with captures the agent’s accumulated set of observations, as well as a neural
  net architecture called a Node Edge Predictor (NEP) that extracts information from
  the SGM to search efficiently. We evaluate our method in the Dynamic House Simulator,
  a new benchmark that creates diverse dynamic graphs following the semantic patterns
  typically seen at homes, and show that NEP can be trained to predict the locations
  of objects in a variety of environments with diverse object movement dynamics, outperforming
  baselines both in terms of new scene adaptability and overall accuracy. The codebase
  and more can be found www.scenegraphmemory.com.'
