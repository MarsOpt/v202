title: Provable Data Subset Selection For Efficient Neural Networks Training
openreview: QlxwTDQfPp
abstract: Radial basis function neural networks (<em>RBFNN</em>) are well-known for
  their capability to approximate any continuous function on a closed bounded set
  with arbitrary precision given enough hidden neurons. In this paper, we introduce
  the first algorithm to construct coresets for <em>RBFNNs</em>, i.e., small weighted
  subsets that approximate the loss of the input data on any radial basis function
  network and thus approximate any function defined by an <em>RBFNN</em> on the larger
  input data. In particular, we construct coresets for radial basis and Laplacian
  loss functions. We then use our coresets to obtain a provable data subset selection
  algorithm for training deep neural networks. Since our coresets approximate every
  function, they also approximate the gradient of each weight in a neural network,
  which is a particular function on the input. We then perform empirical evaluations
  on function approximation and dataset subset selection on popular network architectures
  and data sets, demonstrating the efficacy and accuracy of our coreset construction.
