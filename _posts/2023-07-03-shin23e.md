title: Context Consistency Regularization for Label Sparsity in Time Series
openreview: EvGOdASdHi
abstract: Labels are typically sparse in real-world time series due to the high annotation
  cost. Recently, consistency regularization techniques have been used to generate
  artificial labels from unlabeled augmented instances. To fully exploit the sequential
  characteristic of time series in consistency regularization, we propose a novel
  method of data augmentation called <em>context-attached augmentation</em>, which
  adds preceding and succeeding instances to a target instance to form its augmented
  instance. Unlike the existing augmentation techniques that modify a target instance
  by directly perturbing its attributes, the context-attached augmentation generates
  instances augmented with varying contexts while maintaining the target instance.
  Based on our augmentation method, we propose a <em>context consistency regularization</em>
  framework, which first adds different contexts to a target instance sampled from
  a given time series and then shares unitary reliability-based cross-window labels
  across the augmented instances to maintain consistency. We demonstrate that the
  proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art consistency regularization
  frameworks through comprehensive experiments on real-world time-series datasets.
