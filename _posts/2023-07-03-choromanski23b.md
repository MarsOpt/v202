title: Efficient Graph Field Integrators Meet Point Clouds
openreview: Y5jGkbZ0W3
abstract: We present two new classes of algorithms for efficient field integration
  on graphs encoding point cloud data. The first class, $\mathrm{SeparatorFactorization}$
  (SF), leverages the bounded genus of point cloud mesh graphs, while the second class,
  $\mathrm{RFDiffusion}$ (RFD), uses popular $\epsilon$-nearest-neighbor graph representations
  for point clouds. Both can be viewed as providing the functionality of Fast Multipole
  Methods (FMMs), which have had a tremendous impact on efficient integration, but
  for non-Euclidean spaces. We focus on geometries induced by distributions of walk
  lengths between points (e.g. shortest-path distance). We provide an extensive theoretical
  analysis of our algorithms, obtaining new results in structural graph theory as
  a byproduct. We also perform exhaustive empirical evaluation, including on-surface
  interpolation for rigid and deformable objects (in particular for mesh-dynamics
  modeling) as well as Wasserstein distance computations for point clouds, including
  the Gromov-Wasserstein variant.
