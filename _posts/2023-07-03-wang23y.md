title: 'GC-Flow: A Graph-Based Flow Network for Effective Clustering'
openreview: NRJPnlZ1JI
abstract: 'Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are <em>discriminative models</em>
  that directly model the class posterior $p(y|\mathbf{x})$ for semi-supervised classification
  of graph data. While being effective, as a representation learning approach, the
  node representations extracted from a GCN often miss useful information for effective
  clustering, because the objectives are different. In this work, we design normalizing
  flows that replace GCN layers, leading to a <em>generative model</em> that models
  both the class conditional likelihood $p(\mathbf{x}|y)$ and the class prior $p(y)$.
  The resulting neural network, GC-Flow, retains the graph convolution operations
  while being equipped with a Gaussian mixture representation space. It enjoys two
  benefits: it not only maintains the predictive power of GCN, but also produces well-separated
  clusters, due to the structuring of the representation space. We demonstrate these
  benefits on a variety of benchmark data sets. Moreover, we show that additional
  parameterization, such as that on the adjacency matrix used for graph convolutions,
  yields additional improvement in clustering.'
