title: 'DeSRA: Detect and Delete the Artifacts of GAN-based Real-World Super-Resolution
  Models'
openreview: M0bwbIl4Bl
abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) with generative adversarial networks (GAN) has
  achieved great success in restoring realistic details. However, it is notorious
  that GAN-based SR models will inevitably produce unpleasant and undesirable artifacts,
  especially in practical scenarios. Previous works typically suppress artifacts with
  an extra loss penalty in the training phase. They only work for in-distribution
  artifact types generated during training. When applied in real-world scenarios,
  we observe that those improved methods still generate obviously annoying artifacts
  during inference. In this paper, we analyze the cause and characteristics of the
  GAN artifacts produced in unseen test data without ground-truths. We then develop
  a novel method, namely, DeSRA, to Detect and then “Delete” those SR Artifacts in
  practice. Specifically, we propose to measure a relative local variance distance
  from MSE-SR results and GAN-SR results, and locate the problematic areas based on
  the above distance and semantic-aware thresholds. After detecting the artifact regions,
  we develop a finetune procedure to improve GAN-based SR models with a few samples,
  so that they can deal with similar types of artifacts in more unseen real data.
  Equipped with our DeSRA, we can successfully eliminate artifacts from inference
  and improve the ability of SR models to be applied in real-world scenarios. The
  code will be available at https://github.com/TencentARC/DeSRA.
