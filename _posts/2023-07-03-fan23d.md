title: Smart Initial Basis Selection for Linear Programs
openreview: Mha86sOok1
abstract: The simplex method, introduced by Dantzig more than half a century ago,
  is still to date one of the most efficient methods for solving large-scale linear
  programming (LP) problems. While the simplex method is known to have the finite
  termination property under mild assumptions, the number of iterations until optimality
  largely depends on the choice of initial basis. Existing strategies for selecting
  an advanced initial basis are mostly rule-based. These rules usually require extensive
  expert knowledge and empirical study to develop. Yet, many of them fail to exhibit
  consistent improvement, even for LP problems that arise in a single application
  scenario. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach for initial basis
  selection. We employ graph neural networks as a building block and develop a model
  that attempts to capture the relationship between LP problems and their optimal
  bases. In addition, during the inference phase, we supplement the learning-based
  prediction with linear algebra tricks to ensure the validity of the generated initial
  basis. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy by extensively testing
  it with state-of-the-art simplex solvers, including the open-source solver HiGHS
  and the commercial solver OptVerse. Through these rigorous experiments, we demonstrate
  that our strategy achieves substantial speedup and consistently outperforms existing
  rule-based methods. Furthermore, we extend the proposed approach to generating restricted
  master problems for column generation methods and present encouraging numerical
  results.
