title: 'HETAL: Efficient Privacy-preserving Transfer Learning with Homomorphic Encryption'
openreview: jJXuL3hQvt
abstract: Transfer learning is a de facto standard method for efficiently training
  machine learning models for data-scarce problems by adding and fine-tuning new classification
  layers to a model pre-trained on large datasets. Although numerous previous studies
  proposed to use homomorphic encryption to resolve the data privacy issue in transfer
  learning in the machine learning as a service setting, most of them only focused
  on encrypted inference. In this study, we present HETAL, an efficient Homomorphic
  Encryption based Transfer Learning algorithm, that protects the client’s privacy
  in training tasks by encrypting the client data using the CKKS homomorphic encryption
  scheme. HETAL is the first practical scheme that strictly provides encrypted training,
  adopting validation-based early stopping and achieving the accuracy of nonencrypted
  training. We propose an efficient encrypted matrix multiplication algorithm, which
  is 1.8 to 323 times faster than prior methods, and a highly precise softmax approximation
  algorithm with increased coverage. The experimental results for five well-known
  benchmark datasets show total training times of 567–3442 seconds, which is less
  than an hour.
