title: Adaptive Barrier Smoothing for First-Order Policy Gradient with Contact Dynamics
openreview: 68lnr83obY
abstract: Differentiable physics-based simulators have witnessed remarkable success
  in robot learning involving contact dynamics, benefiting from their improved accuracy
  and efficiency in solving the underlying complementarity problem. However, when
  utilizing the First-Order Policy Gradient (FOPG) method, our theory indicates that
  the complementarity-based systems suffer from stiffness, leading to an explosion
  in the gradient variance of FOPG. As a result, optimization becomes challenging
  due to chaotic and non-smooth loss landscapes. To tackle this issue, we propose
  a novel approach called Adaptive Barrier Smoothing (ABS), which introduces a class
  of softened complementarity systems that correspond to barrier-smoothed objectives.
  With a contact-aware adaptive central-path parameter, ABS reduces the FOPG gradient
  variance while controlling the gradient bias. We justify the adaptive design by
  analyzing the roots of the systemâ€™s stiffness. Additionally, we establish the convergence
  of FOPG and show that ABS achieves a reasonable trade-off between the gradient variance
  and bias by providing their upper bounds. Moreover, we present a variant of FOPG
  based on complementarity modeling that efficiently fits the contact dynamics by
  learning the physical parameters. Experimental results on various robotic tasks
  are provided to support our theory and method.
