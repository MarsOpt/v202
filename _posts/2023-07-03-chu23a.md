title: Wasserstein Barycenter Matching for Graph Size Generalization of Message Passing
  Neural Networks
openreview: Z1I4WrV5TG
abstract: Graph size generalization is hard for Message passing neural networks (MPNNs).
  The graph-level classification performance of MPNNs degrades across various graph
  sizes. Recently, theoretical studies reveal that a slow uncontrollable convergence
  rate w.r.t. graph size could adversely affect the size generalization. To address
  the uncontrollable convergence rate caused by correlations across nodes in the underlying
  dimensional signal-generating space, we propose to use Wasserstein barycenters as
  graph-level consensus to combat node-level correlations. Methodologically, we propose
  a Wasserstein barycenter matching (WBM) layer that represents an input graph by
  Wasserstein distances between its MPNN-filtered node embeddings versus some learned
  class-wise barycenters. Theoretically, we show that the convergence rate of an MPNN
  with a WBM layer is controllable and independent to the dimensionality of the signal-generating
  space. Thus MPNNs with WBM layers are less susceptible to slow uncontrollable convergence
  rate and size variations. Empirically, the WBM layer improves the size generalization
  over vanilla MPNNs with different backbones (e.g., GCN, GIN, and PNA) significantly
  on real-world graph datasets.
