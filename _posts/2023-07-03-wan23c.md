title: 'SeMAIL: Eliminating Distractors in Visual Imitation via Separated Models'
openreview: yXt417LWyI
abstract: Model-based imitation learning (MBIL) is a popular reinforcement learning
  method that improves sample efficiency on high-dimension input sources, such as
  images and videos. Following the convention of MBIL research, existing algorithms
  are highly deceptive by task-irrelevant information, especially moving distractors
  in videos. To tackle this problem, we propose a new algorithm - named Separated
  Model-based Adversarial Imitation Learning (SeMAIL) - decoupling the environment
  dynamics into two parts by task-relevant dependency, which is determined by agent
  actions, and training separately. In this way, the agent can imagine its trajectories
  and imitate the expert behavior efficiently in task-relevant state space. Our method
  achieves near-expert performance on various visual control tasks with complex observations
  and the more challenging tasks with different backgrounds from expert observations.
