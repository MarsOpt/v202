title: 'Atari-5: Distilling the Arcade Learning Environment down to Five Games'
openreview: xRDHjO0YBo
abstract: The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) has become an essential benchmark
  for assessing the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. However, the
  computational cost of generating results on the entire 57-game dataset limits ALEâ€™s
  use and makes the reproducibility of many results infeasible. We propose a novel
  solution to this problem in the form of a principled methodology for selecting small
  but representative subsets of environments within a benchmark suite. We applied
  our method to identify a subset of five ALE games, we call <em>Atari-5</em>, which
  produces 57-game median score estimates within 10% of their true values. Extending
  the subset to 10-games recovers 80% of the variance for log-scores for <em>all</em>
  games within the 57-game set. We show this level of compression is possible due
  to a high degree of correlation between many of the games in ALE.
