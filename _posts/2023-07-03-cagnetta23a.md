title: What Can Be Learnt With Wide Convolutional Neural Networks?
openreview: Wz7a5MbBQa
abstract: Understanding how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can efficiently learn
  high-dimensional functions remains a fundamental challenge. A popular belief is
  that these models harness the local and hierarchical structure of natural data such
  as images. Yet, we lack a quantitative understanding of how such structure affects
  performance, e.g., the rate of decay of the generalisation error with the number
  of training samples. In this paper, we study infinitely-wide deep CNNs in the kernel
  regime. First, we show that the spectrum of the corresponding kernel inherits the
  hierarchical structure of the network, and we characterise its asymptotics. Then,
  we use this result together with generalisation bounds to prove that deep CNNs adapt
  to the spatial scale of the target function. In particular, we find that if the
  target function depends on low-dimensional subsets of adjacent input variables,
  then the decay of the error is controlled by the effective dimensionality of these
  subsets. Conversely, if the target function depends on the full set of input variables,
  then the error decay is controlled by the input dimension. We conclude by computing
  the generalisation error of a deep CNN trained on the output of another deep CNN
  with randomly-initialised parameters. Interestingly, we find that, despite their
  hierarchical structure, the functions generated by infinitely-wide deep CNNs are
  too rich to be efficiently learnable in high dimension.
