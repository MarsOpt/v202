title: Constrained Causal Bayesian Optimization
openreview: 60bhXDeTos
abstract: We propose constrained causal Bayesian optimization (cCBO), an approach
  for finding interventions in a known causal graph that optimize a target variable
  under some constraints. cCBO first reduces the search space by exploiting the graph
  structure and, if available, an observational dataset; and then solves the restricted
  optimization problem by modelling target and constraint quantities using Gaussian
  processes and by sequentially selecting interventions via a constrained expected
  improvement acquisition function. We propose different surrogate models that enable
  to integrate observational and interventional data while capturing correlation among
  effects with increasing levels of sophistication. We evaluate cCBO on artificial
  and real-world causal graphs showing successful trade off between fast convergence
  and percentage of feasible interventions.
