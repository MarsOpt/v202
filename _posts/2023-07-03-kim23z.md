title: Denoising MCMC for Accelerating Diffusion-Based Generative Models
openreview: GOousx8DUL
abstract: 'The sampling process of diffusion models can be interpreted as solving
  the reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) or the ordinary differential
  equation (ODE) of the diffusion process, which often requires up to thousands of
  discretization steps to generate a single image. This has sparked a great interest
  in developing efficient integration techniques for reverse-S/ODEs. Here, we propose
  an orthogonal approach to accelerating score-based sampling: Denoising MCMC (DMCMC).
  DMCMC first uses MCMC to produce initialization points for reverse-S/ODE in the
  product space of data and diffusion time. Then, a reverse-S/ODE integrator is used
  to denoise the initialization points. Since MCMC traverses close to the data manifold,
  the cost of producing a clean sample for DMCMC is much less than that of producing
  a clean sample from noise. Denoising Langevin Gibbs, an instance of DMCMC, successfully
  accelerates all six reverse-S/ODE integrators considered in this work, and achieves
  state-of-the-art results: in the limited number of score function evaluation (NFE)
  setting on CIFAR10, we have $3.25$ FID with $\approx 10$ NFE and $2.49$ FID with
  $\approx 16$ NFE. On CelebA-HQ-256, we have $6.99$ FID with $\approx 160$ NFE, which
  beats the current best record of Kim et al. (2022) among score-based models, $7.16$
  FID with $4000$ NFE. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/DMCMC'
