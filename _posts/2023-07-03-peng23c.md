title: 'Diagnosis, Feedback, Adaptation: A Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Test-Time
  Policy Adaptation'
openreview: rFLtREMkTR
abstract: Policies often fail at test-time due to <em>distribution shifts</em>—changes
  in the state and reward that occur when an end user deploys the policy in environments
  different from those seen in training. Data augmentation can help models be more
  robust to such shifts by varying specific concepts in the state, e.g. object color,
  that are <em>task-irrelevant</em> and should not impact desired actions. However,
  designers training the agent don’t often know which concepts are irrelevant <em>a
  priori</em>. We propose a human-in-the-loop framework to leverage feedback from
  the end user to quickly identify and augment task-irrelevant visual state concepts.
  Our framework generates <em>counterfactual demonstrations</em> that allow users
  to quickly isolate shifted state concepts and identify if they should not impact
  the desired task, and can therefore be augmented using existing actions. We present
  experiments validating our full pipeline on discrete and continuous control tasks
  with real human users. Our method better enables users to (1) understand agent failure,
  (2) improve sample efficiency of demonstrations required for finetuning, and (3)
  adapt the agent to their desired reward.
