title: 'BiBench: Benchmarking and Analyzing Network Binarization'
openreview: 2bUddKNVf8
abstract: Network binarization emerges as one of the most promising compression approaches
  offering extraordinary computation and memory savings by minimizing the bit-width.
  However, recent research has shown that applying existing binarization algorithms
  to diverse tasks, architectures, and hardware in realistic scenarios is still not
  straightforward. Common challenges of binarization, such as accuracy degradation
  and efficiency limitation, suggest that its attributes are not fully understood.
  To close this gap, we present BiBench, a rigorously designed benchmark with in-depth
  analysis for network binarization. We first carefully scrutinize the requirements
  of binarization in the actual production and define evaluation tracks and metrics
  for a comprehensive and fair investigation. Then, we evaluate and analyze a series
  of milestone binarization algorithms that function at the operator level and with
  extensive influence. Our benchmark reveals that 1) the binarized operator has a
  crucial impact on the performance and deployability of binarized networks; 2) the
  accuracy of binarization varies significantly across different learning tasks and
  neural architectures; 3) binarization has demonstrated promising efficiency potential
  on edge devices despite the limited hardware support. The results and analysis also
  lead to a promising paradigm for accurate and efficient binarization. We believe
  that BiBench will contribute to the broader adoption of binarization and serve as
  a foundation for future research. The code for our BiBench is released https://github.com/htqin/BiBench
