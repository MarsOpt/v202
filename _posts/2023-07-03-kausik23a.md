title: Learning Mixtures of Markov Chains and MDPs
openreview: wZdykpFd6U
abstract: We present an algorithm for learning mixtures of Markov chains and Markov
  decision processes (MDPs) from short unlabeled trajectories. Specifically, our method
  handles mixtures of Markov chains with optional control input by going through a
  multi-step process, involving (1) a subspace estimation step, (2) spectral clustering
  of trajectories using "pairwise distance estimators," along with refinement using
  the EM algorithm, (3) a model estimation step, and (4) a classification step for
  predicting labels of new trajectories. We provide end-to-end performance guarantees,
  where we only explicitly require the length of trajectories to be linear in the
  number of states and the number of trajectories to be linear in a mixing time parameter.
  Experimental results support these guarantees, where we attain 96.6% average accuracy
  on a mixture of two MDPs in gridworld, outperforming the EM algorithm with random
  initialization (73.2% average accuracy). We also significantly outperform the EM
  algorithm on real data from the LastFM song dataset.
