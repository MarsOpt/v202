title: 'Model-Aware Contrastive Learning: Towards Escaping the Dilemmas'
openreview: Ap95Yc466M
abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) continuously achieves significant breakthroughs
  across multiple domains. However, the most common InfoNCE-based methods suffer from
  some dilemmas, such as uniformity-tolerance dilemma (UTD) and gradient reduction,
  both of which are related to a $\mathcal{P}_{ij}$ term. It has been identified that
  UTD can lead to unexpected performance degradation. We argue that the fixity of
  temperature is to blame for UTD. To tackle this challenge, we enrich the CL loss
  family by presenting a Model-Aware Contrastive Learning (MACL) strategy, whose temperature
  is adaptive to the magnitude of alignment that reflects the basic confidence of
  the instance discrimination task, then enables CL loss to adjust the penalty strength
  for hard negatives adaptively. Regarding another dilemma, the gradient reduction
  issue, we derive the limits of an involved gradient scaling factor, which allows
  us to explain from a unified perspective why some recent approaches are effective
  with fewer negative samples, and summarily present a gradient reweighting to escape
  this dilemma. Extensive remarkable empirical results in vision, sentence, and graph
  modality validate our approachâ€™s general improvement for representation learning
  and downstream tasks.
