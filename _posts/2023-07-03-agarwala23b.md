title: Second-order regression models exhibit progressive sharpening to the edge of
  stability
openreview: mP79L3pOke
abstract: Recent studies of gradient descent with large step sizes have shown that
  there is often a regime with an initial increase in the largest eigenvalue of the
  loss Hessian (progressive sharpening), followed by a stabilization of the eigenvalue
  near the maximum value which allows convergence (edge of stability). These phenomena
  are intrinsically non-linear and do not happen for models in the constant Neural
  Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, for which the predictive function is approximately
  linear in the parameters. As such, we consider the next simplest class of predictive
  models, namely those that are quadratic in the parameters, which we call second-order
  regression models. For quadratic objectives in two dimensions, we prove that this
  second-order regression model exhibits progressive sharpening of the NTK eigenvalue
  towards a value that differs slightly from the edge of stability, which we explicitly
  compute. In higher dimensions, the model generically shows similar behavior, even
  without the specific structure of a neural network, suggesting that progressive
  sharpening and edge-of-stability behavior arenâ€™t unique features of neural networks,
  and could be a more general property of discrete learning algorithms in high-dimensional
  non-linear models.
