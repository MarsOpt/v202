title: Multi-Objective GFlowNets
openreview: yu3Q5iU9hi
abstract: 'We study the problem of generating <em>diverse</em> candidates in the context
  of Multi-Objective Optimization. In many applications of machine learning such as
  drug discovery and material design, the goal is to generate candidates which simultaneously
  optimize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. Moreover, these objectives
  are often imperfect evaluations of some underlying property of interest, making
  it important to generate diverse candidates to have multiple options for expensive
  downstream evaluations. We propose Multi-Objective GFlowNets (MOGFNs), a novel method
  for generating diverse Pareto optimal solutions, based on GFlowNets. We introduce
  two variants of MOGFNs: MOGFN-PC, which models a family of independent sub-problems
  defined by a scalarization function, with reward-conditional GFlowNets, and MOGFN-AL,
  which solves a sequence of sub-problems defined by an acquisition function in an
  active learning loop. Our experiments on wide variety of synthetic and benchmark
  tasks demonstrate advantages of the proposed methods in terms of the Pareto performance
  and importantly, improved candidate diversity, which is the main contribution of
  this work.'
