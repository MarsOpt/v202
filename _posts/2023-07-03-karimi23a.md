title: 'On the Relationship Between Explanation and Prediction: A Causal View'
openreview: EUQsBO975P
abstract: Being able to provide explanations for a model’s decision has become a central
  requirement for the development, deployment, and adoption of machine learning models.
  However, we are yet to understand what explanation methods can and cannot do. How
  do upstream factors such as data, model prediction, hyperparameters, and random
  initialization influence downstream explanations? While previous work raised concerns
  that explanations (E) may have little relationship with the prediction (Y), there
  is a lack of conclusive study to quantify this relationship. Our work borrows tools
  from causal inference to systematically assay this relationship. More specifically,
  we study the relationship between E and Y by measuring the treatment effect when
  intervening on their causal ancestors, i.e., on hyperparameters and inputs used
  to generate saliency-based Es or Ys. Our results suggest that the relationships
  between E and Y is far from ideal. In fact, the gap between ’ideal’ case only increase
  in higher-performing models — models that are likely to be deployed. Our work is
  a promising first step towards providing a quantitative measure of the relationship
  between E and Y, which could also inform the future development of methods for E
  with a quantitative metric.
