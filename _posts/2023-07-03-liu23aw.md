title: 'Gradient-based Wang-Landau Algorithm: A Novel Sampler for Output Distribution
  of Neural Networks over the Input Space'
openreview: dxTu7PlNZz
abstract: The output distribution of a neural network (NN) over the entire input space
  captures the complete input-output mapping relationship, offering in- sights toward
  a more comprehensive NN under- standing. Exhaustive enumeration or traditional Monte
  Carlo methods for the entire input space can exhibit impractical sampling time,
  especially for high-dimensional inputs. To make such difficult sampling computationally
  feasible, in this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-based Wang-Landau (GWL) sampler.
  We first draw the connection between the output distribution of a NN and the density
  of states (DOS) of a physical system. Then, we renovate the classic sampler for
  the DOS problem, Wang-Landau algorithm, by re-placing its random proposals with
  gradient-based Monte Carlo proposals. This way, our GWL sampler investigates the
  under-explored subsets of the input space much more efficiently. Extensive experiments
  have verified the accuracy of the output distribution generated by GWL and also
  showcased several interesting findings - for example, in a binary image classification
  task, both CNN and ResNet mapped the majority of human unrecognizable images to
  very negative logit values.
