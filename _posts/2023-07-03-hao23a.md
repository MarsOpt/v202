title: 'Leveraging Demonstrations to Improve Online Learning: Quality Matters'
openreview: umyRFbogWh
abstract: We investigate the extent to which offline demonstration data can improve
  online learning. It is natural to expect some improvement, but <em>the question
  is how, and by how much?</em> We show that the degree of improvement must depend
  on the <em>quality</em> of the demonstration data. To generate portable insights,
  we focus on Thompson sampling (TS) applied to a multi-armed bandit as a prototypical
  online learning algorithm and model. The demonstration data is generated by an expert
  with a given <em>competence</em> level, a notion we introduce. We propose an informed
  TS algorithm that utilizes the demonstration data in a coherent way through Bayes’
  rule and derive a prior-dependent Bayesian regret bound. This offers insight into
  how pretraining can greatly improve online performance and how the degree of improvement
  increases with the expert’s competence level. We also develop a practical, approximate
  informed TS algorithm through Bayesian bootstrapping and show substantial empirical
  regret reduction through experiments.
