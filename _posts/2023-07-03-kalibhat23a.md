title: Identifying Interpretable Subspaces in Image Representations
openreview: 5YUyJYElAc
abstract: We propose Automatic Feature Explanation using Contrasting Concepts (FALCON),
  an interpretability framework to explain features of image representations. For
  a target feature, FALCON captions its highly activating cropped images using a large
  captioning dataset (like LAION-400m) and a pre-trained vision-language model like
  CLIP. Each word among the captions is scored and ranked leading to a small number
  of shared, human-understandable concepts that closely describe the target feature.
  FALCON also applies contrastive interpretation using lowly activating (counterfactual)
  images, to eliminate spurious concepts. Although many existing approaches interpret
  features independently, we observe in state-of-the-art self-supervised and supervised
  models, that less than 20% of the representation space can be explained by individual
  features. We show that features in larger spaces become more interpretable when
  studied in groups and can be explained with high-order scoring concepts through
  FALCON. We discuss how extracted concepts can be used to explain and debug failures
  in downstream tasks. Finally, we present a technique to transfer concepts from one
  (explainable) representation space to another unseen representation space by learning
  a simple linear transformation.
