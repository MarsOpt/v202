title: 'Federated Adversarial Learning: A Framework with Convergence Analysis'
openreview: kgvoV2KcTJ
abstract: 'Federated learning (FL) is a trending training paradigm to utilize decentralized
  training data. FL allows clients to update model parameters locally for several
  epochs, then share them to a global model for aggregation. This training paradigm
  with multi-local step updating before aggregation exposes unique vulnerabilities
  to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is a popular and effective method to
  improve the robustness of networks against adversaries. In this work, we formulate
  a general form of federated adversarial learning (FAL) that is adapted from adversarial
  learning in the centralized setting. On the client side of FL training, FAL has
  an inner loop to generate adversarial samples for adversarial training and an outer
  loop to update local model parameters. On the server side, FAL aggregates local
  model updates and broadcast the aggregated model. We design a global robust training
  loss and formulate FAL training as a min-max optimization problem. Unlike the convergence
  analysis in classical centralized training that relies on the gradient direction,
  it is significantly harder to analyze the convergence in FAL for three reasons:
  1) the complexity of min-max optimization, 2) model not updating in the gradient
  direction due to the multi-local updates on the client-side before aggregation and
  3) inter-client heterogeneity. We address these challenges by using appropriate
  gradient approximation and coupling techniques and present the convergence analysis
  in the over-parameterized regime. Our main result theoretically shows that the minimum
  loss under our algorithm can converge to $\epsilon$ small with chosen learning rate
  and communication rounds. It is noteworthy that our analysis is feasible for non-IID
  clients.'
