title: One-Shot Federated Conformal Prediction
openreview: SZJGIWe1Ag
abstract: In this paper, we present a Conformal Prediction method that computes prediction
  sets in a one-shot Federated Learning (FL) setting. More specifically, we introduce
  a novel quantile-of-quantiles estimator and prove that for any distribution, it
  is possible to compute prediction sets with desired coverage in only one round of
  communication. To mitigate privacy issues, we also describe a locally differentially
  private version of our estimator. Finally, over a wide range of experiments, we
  show that our method returns prediction sets with coverage and length very similar
  to those obtained in a centralized setting. These results demonstrate that our method
  is well-suited for one-shot Federated Learning.
