title: How Powerful are Shallow Neural Networks with Bandlimited Random Weights?
openreview: KGt3YmRJyk
abstract: 'We investigate the expressive power of depth-2 bandlimited random neural
  networks. A random net is a neural network where the hidden layer parameters are
  frozen with random assignment, and only the output layer parameters are trained
  by loss minimization. Using random weights for a hidden layer is an effective method
  to avoid non-convex optimization in standard gradient descent learning. It has also
  been adopted in recent deep learning theories. Despite the well-known fact that
  a neural network is a universal approximator, in this study, we mathematically show
  that when hidden parameters are distributed in a bounded domain, the network may
  not achieve zero approximation error. In particular, we derive a new nontrivial
  approximation error lower bound. The proof utilizes the technique of ridgelet analysis,
  a harmonic analysis method designed for neural networks. This method is inspired
  by fundamental principles in classical signal processing, specifically the idea
  that signals with limited bandwidth may not always be able to perfectly reconstruct
  the original signal. We corroborate our theoretical results with various simulation
  studies, and generally, two main take-home messages are offered: (i) Not any distribution
  for selecting random weights is feasible to build a universal approximator; (ii)
  A suitable assignment of random weights exists but to some degree is associated
  with the complexity of the target function.'
