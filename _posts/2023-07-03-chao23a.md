title: On Investigating the Conservative Property of Score-Based Generative Models
openreview: I6eJvWRrFa
abstract: Existing Score-Based Models (SBMs) can be categorized into constrained SBMs
  (CSBMs) or unconstrained SBMs (USBMs) according to their parameterization approaches.
  CSBMs model probability density functions as Boltzmann distributions, and assign
  their predictions as the negative gradients of some scalar-valued energy functions.
  On the other hand, USBMs employ flexible architectures capable of directly estimating
  scores without the need to explicitly model energy functions. In this paper, we
  demonstrate that the architectural constraints of CSBMs may limit their modeling
  ability. In addition, we show that USBMs’ inability to preserve the property of
  conservativeness may lead to degraded performance in practice. To address the above
  issues, we propose Quasi-Conservative Score-Based Models (QCSBMs) for keeping the
  advantages of both CSBMs and USBMs. Our theoretical derivations demonstrate that
  the training objective of QCSBMs can be efficiently integrated into the training
  processes by leveraging the Hutchinson’s trace estimator. In addition, our experimental
  results on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and SVHN datasets validate the effectiveness
  of QCSBMs. Finally, we justify the advantage of QCSBMs using an example of a one-layered
  autoencoder.
