title: Nearly Minimax Optimal Regret for Learning Linear Mixture Stochastic Shortest
  Path
openreview: QSiY62elrJ
abstract: We study the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem with a linear mixture
  transition kernel, where an agent repeatedly interacts with a stochastic environment
  and seeks to reach certain goal state while minimizing the cumulative cost. Existing
  works often assume a strictly positive lower bound of the cost function or an upper
  bound of the expected length for the optimal policy. In this paper, we propose a
  new algorithm to eliminate these restrictive assumptions. Our algorithm is based
  on extended value iteration with a fine-grained variance-aware confidence set, where
  the variance is estimated recursively from high-order moments. Our algorithm achieves
  an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(dB_*\sqrt{K})$ regret bound, where $d$ is the dimension
  of the feature mapping in the linear transition kernel, $B_*$ is the upper bound
  of the total cumulative cost for the optimal policy, and $K$ is the number of episodes.
  Our regret upper bound matches the $\Omega(dB_*\sqrt{K})$ lower bound of linear
  mixture SSPs in Min et al. (2022), which suggests that our algorithm is nearly minimax
  optimal.
