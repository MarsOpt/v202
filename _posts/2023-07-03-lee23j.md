title: Minimizing Trajectory Curvature of ODE-based Generative Models
openreview: aAGrNFHmVd
abstract: Recent ODE/SDE-based generative models, such as diffusion models, rectified
  flows, and flow matching, define a generative process as a time reversal of a fixed
  forward process. Even though these models show impressive performance on large-scale
  datasets, numerical simulation requires multiple evaluations of a neural network,
  leading to a slow sampling speed. We attribute the reason to the high curvature
  of the learned generative trajectories, as it is directly related to the truncation
  error of a numerical solver. Based on the relationship between the forward process
  and the curvature, here we present an efficient method of training the forward process
  to minimize the curvature of generative trajectories without any ODE/SDE simulation.
  Experiments show that our method achieves a lower curvature than previous models
  and, therefore, decreased sampling costs while maintaining competitive performance.
