title: 'Locally Regularized Neural Differential Equations: Some Black Boxes were meant
  to remain closed!'
openreview: sdYsEseLu4
abstract: Neural Differential Equations have become an important modeling framework
  due to their ability to adapt to new problems automatically. Training a neural differential
  equation is effectively a search over a space of plausible dynamical systems. Controlling
  the computational cost for these models is difficult since it relies on the number
  of steps the adaptive solver takes. Most prior works have used higher-order methods
  to reduce prediction timings while greatly increasing training time or reducing
  both training and prediction timings by relying on specific training algorithms,
  which are harder to use as a drop-in replacement. In this manuscript, <em>we use
  internal cost heuristics of adaptive differential equation solvers at stochastic
  time-points to guide the training towards learning a dynamical system that is easier
  to integrate</em>. We “close the blackbox” and allow the use of our method with
  any sensitivity method. We perform experimental studies to compare our method to
  global regularization to show that we attain similar performance numbers without
  compromising on the flexibility of implementation. <em>We develop two sampling strategies
  to trade-off between performance and training time</em>. Our method reduces the
  number of function evaluations to 0.556x - 0.733x and accelerates predictions by
  1.3x - 2x.
