title: 'Functional Neural Networks: Shift invariant models for functional data with
  applications to EEG classification'
openreview: vvcJCbxxbp
abstract: 'It is desirable for statistical models to detect signals of interest independently
  of their position. If the data is generated by some smooth process, this additional
  structure should be taken into account. We introduce a new class of neural networks
  that are shift invariant and preserve smoothness of the data: functional neural
  networks (FNNs). For this, we use methods from functional data analysis (FDA) to
  extend multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks to functional data.
  We propose different model architectures, show that the models outperform a benchmark
  model from FDA in terms of accuracy and successfully use FNNs to classify electroencephalography
  (EEG) data.'
