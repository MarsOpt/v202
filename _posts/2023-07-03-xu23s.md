title: 'mPLUG-2: A Modularized Multi-modal Foundation Model Across Text, Image and
  Video'
openreview: DSOmy0ScK6
abstract: Recent years have witnessed a big convergence of language, vision, and multi-modal
  pretraining. In this work, we present mPLUG-2, a new unified paradigm with modularized
  design for multi-modal pretraining, which can benefit from modality collaboration
  while addressing the problem of modality entanglement. In contrast to predominant
  paradigms of solely relying on sequence-to-sequence generation or encoder-based
  instance discrimination, mPLUG-2 introduces a multi-module composition network by
  sharing common universal modules for modality collaboration and disentangling different
  modality modules to deal with modality entanglement. It is flexible to select different
  modules for different understanding and generation tasks across all modalities including
  text, image, and video. Empirical study shows that mPLUG-2 achieves state-of-the-art
  or competitive results on a broad range of over 30 downstream tasks, spanning multi-modal
  tasks of image-text and video-text understanding and generation, and uni-modal tasks
  of text-only, image-only, and video-only understanding. Notably, mPLUG-2 shows new
  state-of-the-art results of 48.0 top-1 accuracy and 80.3 CIDEr on the challenging
  MSRVTT video QA and video caption tasks with a far smaller model size and data scale.
  It also demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability on vision-language and video-language
  tasks. Code and models will be released in https://github.com/X-PLUG/mPLUG-2.
