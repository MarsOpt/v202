title: 'Pricing Experimental Design: Causal Effect, Expected Revenue and Tail Risk'
openreview: a86SXRxhtA
abstract: 'When launching a new product, historical sales data is often not available,
  leaving price as a crucial experimental instrument for sellers to gauge market response.
  When designing pricing experiments, there are three fundamental objectives: estimating
  the causal effect of price (i.e., price elasticity), maximizing the expected revenue
  through the experiment, and controlling the tail risk suffering from a very huge
  loss. In this paper, we reveal the relationship among such three objectives. Under
  a linear structural model, we investigate the trade-offs between causal inference
  and expected revenue maximization, as well as between expected revenue maximization
  and tail risk control. Furthermore, we propose an optimal pricing experimental design,
  which can flexibly adapt to different desired levels of trade-offs. Through the
  optimal design, we also explore the relationship between causal inference and tail
  risk control.'
