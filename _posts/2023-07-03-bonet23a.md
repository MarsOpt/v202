title: Sliced-Wasserstein on Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices for M/EEG Signals
openreview: sixaiuoFnr
abstract: When dealing with electro or magnetoencephalography records, many supervised
  prediction tasks are solved by working with covariance matrices to summarize the
  signals. Learning with these matrices requires the usage of Riemanian geometry to
  account for their structure. In this paper, we propose a new method to deal with
  distributions of covariance matrices, and demonstrate its computational efficiency
  on M/EEG multivariate time series. More specifically, we define a Sliced-Wasserstein
  distance between measures of symmetric positive definite matrices that comes with
  strong theoretical guarantees. Then, we take advantage of its properties and kernel
  methods to apply this discrepancy to brain-age prediction from MEG data, and compare
  it to state-of-the-art algorithms based on Riemannian geometry. Finally, we show
  that it is an efficient surrogate to the Wasserstein distance in domain adaptation
  for Brain Computer Interface applications.
