title: Neural signature kernels as infinite-width-depth-limits of controlled ResNets
openreview: 0rnA1l6WAc
abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of reservoir computing, we consider randomly initialized
  controlled ResNets defined as Euler-discretizations of neural controlled differential
  equations (Neural CDEs), a unified architecture which enconpasses both RNNs and
  ResNets. We show that in the infinite-width-depth limit and under proper scaling,
  these architectures converge weakly to Gaussian processes indexed on some spaces
  of continuous paths and with kernels satisfying certain partial differential equations
  (PDEs) varying according to the choice of activation function $\varphi$, extending
  the results of Hayou (2022); Hayou & Yang (2023) to the controlled and homogeneous
  case. In the special, homogeneous, case where $\varphi$ is the identity, we show
  that the equation reduces to a linear PDE and the limiting kernel agrees with the
  signature kernel of Salvi et al. (2021a). We name this new family of limiting kernels
  neural signature kernels. Finally, we show that in the infinite-depth regime, finite-width
  controlled ResNets converge in distribution to Neural CDEs with random vector fields
  which, depending on whether the weights are shared across layers, are either time-independent
  and Gaussian or behave like a matrix-valued Brownian motion.
