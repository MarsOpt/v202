title: Towards Constituting Mathematical Structures for Learning to Optimize
openreview: Tm7NpcjSE4
abstract: Learning to Optimize (L2O), a technique that utilizes machine learning to
  learn an optimization algorithm automatically from data, has gained arising attention
  in recent years. A generic L2O approach parameterizes the iterative update rule
  and learns the update direction as a black-box network. While the generic approach
  is widely applicable, the learned model can overfit and may not generalize well
  to out-of-distribution test sets. In this paper, we derive the basic mathematical
  conditions that successful update rules commonly satisfy. Consequently, we propose
  a novel L2O model with a mathematics-inspired structure that is broadly applicable
  and generalized well to out-of-distribution problems. Numerical simulations validate
  our theoretical findings and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the
  proposed L2O model.
