title: 'GeCoNeRF: Few-shot Neural Radiance Fields via Geometric Consistency'
openreview: 32h1MpQ3W1
abstract: We present a novel framework to regularize Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)
  in a few-shot setting with a geometry-aware consistency regularization. The proposed
  approach leverages a rendered depth map at unobserved viewpoint to warp sparse input
  images to the unobserved viewpoint and impose them as pseudo ground truths to facilitate
  learning of NeRF. By encouraging such geometry-aware consistency at a feature-level
  instead of using pixel-level reconstruction loss, we regularize the NeRF at semantic
  and structural levels while allowing for modeling view dependent radiance to account
  for color variations across viewpoints. We also propose an effective method to filter
  out erroneous warped solutions, along with training strategies to stabilize training
  during optimization. We show that our model achieves competitive results compared
  to state-of-the-art few-shot NeRF models.
