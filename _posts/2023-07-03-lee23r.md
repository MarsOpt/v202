title: Unsupervised Skill Discovery for Learning Shared Structures across Changing
  Environments
openreview: stTU9gtFvo
abstract: Learning shared structures across changing environments enables an agent
  to efficiently retain obtained knowledge and transfer it between environments. A
  skill is a promising concept to represent shared structures. Several recent works
  proposed unsupervised skill discovery algorithms that can discover useful skills
  without a reward function. However, they focused on discovering skills in stationary
  environments or assumed that a skill being trained is fixed within an episode, which
  is insufficient to learn and represent shared structures. In this paper, we introduce
  a new unsupervised skill discovery algorithm that discovers a set of skills that
  can represent shared structures across changing environments. Our algorithm trains
  incremental skills and encourages a new skill to expand state coverage obtained
  with compositions of previously learned skills. We also introduce a skill evaluation
  process to prevent our skills from containing redundant skills, a common issue in
  previous work. Our experimental results show that our algorithm acquires skills
  that represent shared structures across changing maze navigation and locomotion
  environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our skills are more useful than baselines
  on downstream tasks.
