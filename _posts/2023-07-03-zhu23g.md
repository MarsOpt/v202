title: 'Unleashing Mask: Explore the Intrinsic Out-of-Distribution Detection Capability'
openreview: 9himkcdirP
abstract: 'Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable aspect of secure
  AI when deploying machine learning models in real-world applications. Previous paradigms
  either explore better scoring functions or utilize the knowledge of outliers to
  equip the models with the ability of OOD detection. However, few of them pay attention
  to the intrinsic OOD detection capability of the given model. In this work, we generally
  discover the existence of an intermediate stage of a model trained on in-distribution
  (ID) data having higher OOD detection performance than that of its final stage across
  different settings, and further identify one critical data-level attribution to
  be learning with the atypical samples. Based on such insights, we propose a novel
  method, Unleashing Mask, which aims to restore the OOD discriminative capabilities
  of the well-trained model with ID data. Our method utilizes a mask to figure out
  the memorized atypical samples, and then finetune the model or prune it with the
  introduced mask to forget them. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our method. The code is available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/Unleashing-Mask.'
