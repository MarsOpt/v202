title: Tilted Sparse Additive Models
openreview: YxpkGn5Oly
abstract: Additive models have been burgeoning in data analysis due to their flexible
  representation and desirable interpretability. However, most existing approaches
  are constructed under empirical risk minimization (ERM), and thus perform poorly
  in situations where average performance is not a suitable criterion for the problems
  of interest, e.g., data with complex non-Gaussian noise, imbalanced labels or both
  of them. In this paper, a novel class of sparse additive models is proposed under
  tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM), which addresses the deficiencies in ERM
  by imposing tilted impact on individual losses, and is flexibly capable of achieving
  a variety of learning objectives, e.g., variable selection, robust estimation, imbalanced
  classification and multiobjective learning. On the theoretical side, a learning
  theory analysis which is centered around the generalization bound and function approximation
  error bound (under some specific data distributions) is conducted rigorously. On
  the practical side, an accelerated optimization algorithm is designed by integrating
  Prox-SVRG and random Fourier acceleration technique. The empirical assessments verify
  the competitive performance of our approach on both synthetic and real data.
