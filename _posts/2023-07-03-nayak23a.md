title: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning through Intelligent Information
  Aggregation
openreview: SaZvBUk2q4
abstract: We consider the problem of multi-agent navigation and collision avoidance
  when observations are limited to the local neighborhood of each agent. We propose
  InforMARL, a novel architecture for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) which
  uses local information intelligently to compute paths for all the agents in a decentralized
  manner. Specifically, InforMARL aggregates information about the local neighborhood
  of agents for both the actor and the critic using a graph neural network and can
  be used in conjunction with any standard MARL algorithm. We show that (1) in training,
  InforMARL has better sample efficiency and performance than baseline approaches,
  despite using less information, and (2) in testing, it scales well to environments
  with arbitrary numbers of agents and obstacles. We illustrate these results using
  four task environments, including one with predetermined goals for each agent, and
  one in which the agents collectively try to cover all goals.
