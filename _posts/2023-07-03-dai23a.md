title: 'Chameleon: Adapting to Peer Images for Planting Durable Backdoors in Federated
  Learning'
openreview: HtHFnHrZXu
abstract: In a federated learning (FL) system, distributed clients upload their local
  models to a central server to aggregate into a global model. Malicious clients may
  plant backdoors into the global model through uploading poisoned local models, causing
  images with specific patterns to be misclassified into some target labels. Backdoors
  planted by current attacks are not durable, and vanish quickly once the attackers
  stop model poisoning. In this paper, we investigate the connection between the durability
  of FL backdoors and the relationships between benign images and poisoned images
  (i.e., the images whose labels are flipped to the target label during local training).
  Specifically, benign images with the original and the target labels of the poisoned
  images are found to have key effects on backdoor durability. Consequently, we propose
  a novel attack, Chameleon, which utilizes contrastive learning to further amplify
  such effects towards a more durable backdoor. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  that Chameleon significantly extends the backdoor lifespan over baselines by $1.2\times
  \sim 4\times$, for a wide range of image datasets, backdoor types, and model architectures.
