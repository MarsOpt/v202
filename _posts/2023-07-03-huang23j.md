title: The Power of Uniform Sampling for k-Median
openreview: CAK03E6JCG
abstract: We study the power of uniform sampling for $k$-Median in various metric
  spaces. We relate the query complexity for approximating $k$-Median, to a key parameter
  of the dataset, called the balancedness $\beta \in (0, 1]$ (with $1$ being perfectly
  balanced). We show that any algorithm must make $\Omega(1 / \beta)$ queries to the
  point set in order to achieve $O(1)$-approximation for $k$-Median. This particularly
  implies existing constructions of coresets, a popular data reduction technique,
  cannot be query-efficient. On the other hand, we show a simple uniform sample of
  $\mathrm{poly}(k \epsilon^{-1} \beta^{-1})$ points suffices for $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation
  for $k$-Median for various metric spaces, which nearly matches the lower bound.
  We conduct experiments to verify that in many real datasets, the balancedness parameter
  is usually well bounded, and that the uniform sampling performs consistently well
  even for the case with moderately large balancedness, which justifies that uniform
  sampling is indeed a viable approach for solving $k$-Median.
