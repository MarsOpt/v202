title: 'LIV: Language-Image Representations and Rewards for Robotic Control'
openreview: GobP5KO3bV
abstract: We present Language-Image Value learning (LIV), a unified objective for
  vision-language representation and reward learning from action-free videos with
  text annotations. Exploiting a novel connection between dual reinforcement learning
  and mutual information contrastive learning, the LIV objective trains a multi-modal
  representation that implicitly encodes a universal value function for tasks specified
  as language or image goals. We use LIV to pre-train the first control-centric vision-language
  representation from large human video datasets such as EpicKitchen. Given only a
  language or image goal, the pre-trained LIV model can assign dense rewards to each
  frame in videos of unseen robots or humans attempting that task in unseen environments.
  Further, when some target domain-specific data is available, the same objective
  can be used to fine-tune and improve LIV and even other pre-trained representations
  for robotic control and reward specification in that domain. In our experiments
  on several simulated and real-world robot environments, LIV models consistently
  outperform the best prior input state representations for imitation learning, as
  well as reward specification methods for policy synthesis. Our results validate
  the advantages of joint vision-language representation and reward learning within
  the unified, compact LIV framework.
