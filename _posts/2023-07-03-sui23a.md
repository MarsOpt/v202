title: Adversarial Learning of Distributional Reinforcement Learning
openreview: E8u45VW6Nj
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant advancements in artificial
  intelligence. However, its real-world applications are limited due to differences
  between simulated environments and the actual world. Consequently, it is crucial
  to systematically analyze how each component of the RL system can affect the final
  model performance. In this study, we propose an adversarial learning framework for
  distributional reinforcement learning, which adopts the concept of influence measure
  from the statistics community. This framework enables us to detect performance loss
  caused by either the internal policy structure or the external state observation.
  The proposed influence measure is based on information geometry and has desirable
  properties of invariance. We demonstrate that the influence measure is useful for
  three diagnostic tasks: identifying fragile states in trajectories, determining
  the instability of the policy architecture, and pinpointing anomalously sensitive
  policy parameters.'
