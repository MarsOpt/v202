title: 'PLay: Parametrically Conditioned Layout Generation using Latent Diffusion'
openreview: 2jvwyTm6Pk
abstract: Layout design is an important task in various design fields, including user
  interfaces, document, and graphic design. As this task requires tedious manual effort
  by designers, prior works have attempted to automate this process using generative
  models, but commonly fell short of providing intuitive user controls and achieving
  design objectives. In this paper, we build a conditional latent diffusion model,
  PLay, that generates parametrically conditioned layouts in vector graphic space
  from user-specified guidelines, which are commonly used by designers for representing
  their design intents in current practices. Our method outperforms prior works across
  three datasets on metrics including FID and FD-VG, and in user test. Moreover, it
  brings a novel and interactive experience to professional layout design processes.
