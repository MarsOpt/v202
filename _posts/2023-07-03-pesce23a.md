title: Are Gaussian Data All You Need? The Extents and Limits of Universality in High-Dimensional
  Generalized Linear Estimation
openreview: W6SAzouaKT
abstract: 'In this manuscript we consider the problem of generalized linear estimation
  on Gaussian mixture data with labels given by a single-index model. Our first result
  is a sharp asymptotic expression for the test and training errors in the high-dimensional
  regime. Motivated by the recent stream of results on the Gaussian universality of
  the test and training errors in generalized linear estimation, we ask ourselves
  the question: "when is a single Gaussian enough to characterize the error?". Our
  formula allows us to give sharp answers to this question, both in the positive and
  negative directions. More precisely, we show that the sufficient conditions for
  Gaussian universality (or lack thereof) crucially depend on the alignment between
  the target weights and the means and covariances of the mixture clusters, which
  we precisely quantify. In the particular case of least-squares interpolation, we
  prove a strong universality property of the training error and show it follows a
  simple, closed-form expression. Finally, we apply our results to real datasets,
  clarifying some recent discussions in the literature about Gaussian universality
  of the errors in this context.'
