title: Task-specific experimental design for treatment effect estimation
openreview: jawDXfCldp
abstract: Understanding causality should be a core requirement of any attempt to build
  real impact through AI. Due to the inherent unobservability of counterfactuals,
  large randomised trials (RCTs) are the standard for causal inference. But large
  experiments are generically expensive, and randomisation carries its own costs,
  e.g. when suboptimal decisions are trialed. Recent work has proposed more sample-efficient
  alternatives to RCTs, but these are not adaptable to the downstream application
  for which the causal effect is sought. In this work, we develop a task-specific
  approach to experimental design and derive sampling strategies customised to particular
  downstream applications. Across a range of important tasks, real-world datasets,
  and sample sizes, our method outperforms other benchmarks, e.g. requiring an order-of-magnitude
  less data to match RCT performance on targeted marketing tasks.
