title: Restoration based Generative Models
openreview: YR0TzWNzD8
abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have recently attracted increasing attention
  by showing impressive synthesis quality. DDMs are built on a diffusion process that
  pushes data to the noise distribution and the models learn to denoise. In this paper,
  we establish the interpretation of DDMs in terms of image restoration (IR). Integrating
  IR literature allows us to use an alternative objective and diverse forward processes,
  not confining to the diffusion process. By imposing prior knowledge on the loss
  function grounded on MAP-based estimation, we eliminate the need for the expensive
  sampling of DDMs. Also, we propose a multi-scale training, which improves the performance
  compared to the diffusion process, by taking advantage of the flexibility of the
  forward process. Experimental results demonstrate that our model improves the quality
  and efficiency of both training and inference. Furthermore, we show the applicability
  of our model to inverse problems. We believe that our framework paves the way for
  designing a new type of flexible general generative model.
