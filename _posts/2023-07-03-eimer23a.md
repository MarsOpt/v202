title: Hyperparameters in Reinforcement Learning and How To Tune Them
openreview: 0Vm8Ghcxmp
abstract: In order to improve reproducibility, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has
  been adopting better scientific practices such as standardized evaluation metrics
  and reporting. However, the process of hyperparameter optimization still varies
  widely across papers, which makes it challenging to compare RL algorithms fairly.
  In this paper, we show that hyperparameter choices in RL can significantly affect
  the agentâ€™s final performance and sample efficiency, and that the hyperparameter
  landscape can strongly depend on the tuning seed which may lead to overfitting.
  We therefore propose adopting established best practices from AutoML, such as the
  separation of tuning and testing seeds, as well as principled hyperparameter optimization
  (HPO) across a broad search space. We support this by comparing multiple state-of-the-art
  HPO tools on a range of RL algorithms and environments to their hand-tuned counterparts,
  demonstrating that HPO approaches often have higher performance and lower compute
  overhead. As a result of our findings, we recommend a set of best practices for
  the RL community, which should result in stronger empirical results with fewer computational
  costs, better reproducibility, and thus faster progress. In order to encourage the
  adoption of these practices, we provide plug-and-play implementations of the tuning
  algorithms used in this paper at https://github.com/facebookresearch/how-to-autorl.
