title: Improved Policy Evaluation for Randomized Trials of Algorithmic Resource Allocation
openreview: priTMs7n6e
abstract: We consider the task of evaluating policies of algorithmic resource allocation
  through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Such policies are tasked with optimizing
  the utilization of limited intervention resources, with the goal of maximizing the
  benefits derived. Evaluation of such allocation policies through RCTs proves difficult,
  notwithstanding the scale of the trial, because the individuals’ outcomes are inextricably
  interlinked through resource constraints controlling the policy decisions. Our key
  contribution is to present a new estimator leveraging our proposed novel concept,
  that involves retrospective reshuffling of participants across experimental arms
  at the end of an RCT. We identify conditions under which such reassignments are
  permissible and can be leveraged to construct counterfactual trials, whose outcomes
  can be accurately ascertained, for free. We prove theoretically that such an estimator
  is more accurate than common estimators based on sample means – we show that it
  returns an unbiased estimate and simultaneously reduces variance. We demonstrate
  the value of our approach through empirical experiments on synthetic, semisynthetic
  as well as real case study data and show improved estimation accuracy across the
  board.
