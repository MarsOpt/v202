title: Robust and Scalable Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection
openreview: jWmHbfKeQF
abstract: 'This paper proposes an online, provably robust, and scalable Bayesian approach
  for changepoint detection. The resulting algorithm has key advantages over previous
  work: it provides provable robustness by leveraging the generalised Bayesian perspective,
  and also addresses the scalability issues of previous attempts. Specifically, the
  proposed generalised Bayesian formalism leads to conjugate posteriors whose parameters
  are available in closed form by leveraging diffusion score matching. The resulting
  algorithm is exact, can be updated through simple algebra, and is more than 10 times
  faster than its closest competitor.'
