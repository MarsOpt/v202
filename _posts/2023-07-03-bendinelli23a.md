title: Controllable Neural Symbolic Regression
openreview: EiHX7MfAG0
abstract: In symbolic regression, the objective is to find an analytical expression
  that accurately fits experimental data with the minimal use of mathematical symbols
  such as operators, variables, and constants. However, the combinatorial space of
  possible expressions can make it challenging for traditional evolutionary algorithms
  to find the correct expression in a reasonable amount of time. To address this issue,
  Neural Symbolic Regression (NSR) algorithms have been developed that can quickly
  identify patterns in the data and generate analytical expressions. However, these
  methods, in their current form, lack the capability to incorporate user-defined
  prior knowledge, which is often required in natural sciences and engineering fields.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel neural symbolic regression method,
  named Neural Symbolic Regression with Hypothesis (NSRwH) that enables the explicit
  incorporation of assumptions about the expected structure of the ground-truth expression
  into the prediction process. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed conditioned
  deep learning model outperforms its unconditioned counterparts in terms of accuracy
  while also providing control over the predicted expression structure.
