title: 'Arithmetic Sampling: Parallel Diverse Decoding for Large Language Models'
openreview: EfhmBBrXY2
abstract: Decoding methods for large language models often trade-off between diversity
  of outputs and parallelism of computation. Methods such as beam search and Gumbel
  top-k sampling can guarantee a different output for each element of the beam, but
  are not easy to parallelize. Alternatively, methods such as temperature sampling
  and its modifications (top-k sampling, nucleus sampling, typical decoding, and others),
  are embarrassingly parallel, but have no guarantees about duplicate samples. We
  present a framework for sampling according to an arithmetic code book implicitly
  defined by a large language model, compatible with common sampling variations, with
  provable beam diversity under certain conditions, as well as being embarrassingly
  parallel and providing unbiased and consistent expectations from the original model.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on WMT machine translation, more
  than halving the standard deviation when estimating expected BLEU score reward,
  and closing the BLEU score gap between independent sampling and beam search by up
  to 63%.
