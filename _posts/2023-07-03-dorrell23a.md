title: Meta-Learning the Inductive Bias of Simple Neural Circuits
openreview: 757L5dtuah
abstract: 'Training data is always finite, making it unclear how to generalise to
  unseen situations. But, animals do generalise, wielding Occam’s razor to select
  a parsimonious explanation of their observations. How they do this is called their
  inductive bias, and it is implicitly built into the operation of animals’ neural
  circuits. This relationship between an observed circuit and its inductive bias is
  a useful explanatory window for neuroscience, allowing design choices to be understood
  normatively. However, it is generally very difficult to map circuit structure to
  inductive bias. Here, we present a neural network tool to bridge this gap. The tool
  meta-learns the inductive bias by learning functions that a neural circuit finds
  easy to generalise, since easy-to-generalise functions are exactly those the circuit
  chooses to explain incomplete data. In systems with analytically known inductive
  bias, i.e. linear and kernel regression, our tool recovers it. Generally, we show
  it can flexibly extract inductive biases from supervised learners, including spiking
  neural networks, and show how it could be applied to real animals. Finally, we use
  our tool to interpret recent connectomic data illustrating our intended use: understanding
  the role of circuit features through the resulting inductive bias.'
