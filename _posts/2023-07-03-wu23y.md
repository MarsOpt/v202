title: 'dugMatting: Decomposed-Uncertainty-Guided Matting'
openreview: iSxFInGln2
abstract: Cutting out an object and estimating its opacity mask, known as image matting,
  is a key task in image and video editing. Due to the highly ill-posed issue, additional
  inputs, typically user-defined trimaps or scribbles, are usually needed to reduce
  the uncertainty. Although effective, it is either time consuming or only suitable
  for experienced users who know where to place the strokes. In this work, we propose
  a decomposed-uncertainty-guided matting (dugMatting) algorithm, which explores the
  explicitly decomposed uncertainties to efficiently and effectively improve the results.
  Basing on the characteristic of these uncertainties, the epistemic uncertainty is
  reduced in the process of guiding interaction (which introduces prior knowledge),
  while the aleatoric uncertainty is reduced in modeling data distribution (which
  introduces statistics for both data and possible noise). The proposed matting framework
  relieves the requirement for users to determine the interaction areas by using simple
  and efficient labeling. Extensively quantitative and qualitative results validate
  that the proposed method significantly improves the original matting algorithms
  in terms of both efficiency and efficacy.
