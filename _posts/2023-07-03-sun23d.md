title: What Makes Entities Similar? A Similarity Flooding Perspective for Multi-sourced
  Knowledge Graph Embeddings
openreview: kMWdo7dZUk
abstract: Joint representation learning over multi-sourced knowledge graphs (KGs)
  yields transferable and expressive embeddings that improve downstream tasks. Entity
  alignment (EA) is a critical step in this process. Despite recent considerable research
  progress in embedding-based EA, how it works remains to be explored. In this paper,
  we provide a similarity flooding perspective to explain existing translation-based
  and aggregation-based EA models. We prove that the embedding learning process of
  these models actually seeks a fixpoint of pairwise similarities between entities.
  We also provide experimental evidence to support our theoretical analysis. We propose
  two simple but effective methods inspired by the fixpoint computation in similarity
  flooding, and demonstrate their effectiveness on benchmark datasets. Our work bridges
  the gap between recent embedding-based models and the conventional similarity flooding
  algorithm. It would improve our understanding of and increase our faith in embedding-based
  EA.
