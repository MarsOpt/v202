title: Generalized-Smooth Nonconvex Optimization is As Efficient As Smooth Nonconvex
  Optimization
openreview: v50lXuFMW0
abstract: Various optimal gradient-based algorithms have been developed for smooth
  nonconvex optimization. However, many nonconvex machine learning problems do not
  belong to the class of smooth functions and therefore the existing algorithms are
  sub-optimal. Instead, these problems have been shown to satisfy certain generalized-smooth
  conditions, which have not been well understood in the existing literature. In this
  paper, we propose a notion of $\alpha$-symmetric generalized-smoothness that substantially
  extends the existing notions and covers many important functions such as high-order
  polynomials and exponential functions. We study the fundamental properties and establish
  descent lemmas for the functions in this class. Then, to solve such a large class
  of nonconvex problems, we design a special deterministic normalized gradient descent
  algorithm that achieves the optimal iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$,
  and also prove that the popular SPIDER variance reduction algorithm achieves the
  optimal sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$. Our results show that solving
  generalized-smooth nonconvex problems is as efficient as solving smooth nonconvex
  problems.
