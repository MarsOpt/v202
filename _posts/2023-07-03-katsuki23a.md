title: Regression with Sensor Data Containing Incomplete Observations
openreview: nBOMpkrb7b
abstract: This paper addresses a regression problem in which output label values are
  the results of sensing the magnitude of a phenomenon. A low value of such labels
  can mean either that the actual magnitude of the phenomenon was low or that the
  sensor made an incomplete observation. This leads to a bias toward lower values
  in labels and the resultant learning because labels may have lower values due to
  incomplete observations, even if the actual magnitude of the phenomenon was high.
  Moreover, because an incomplete observation does not provide any tags indicating
  incompleteness, we cannot eliminate or impute them. To address this issue, we propose
  a learning algorithm that explicitly models incomplete observations corrupted with
  an asymmetric noise that always has a negative value. We show that our algorithm
  is unbiased as if it were learned from uncorrupted data that does not involve incomplete
  observations. We demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm through numerical experiments.
