title: 'I$^2$SB: Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge'
openreview: WH2Cy3eQd0
abstract: 'We propose Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (I$^2$SB), a new class of
  conditional diffusion models that directly learn the nonlinear diffusion processes
  between two given distributions. These diffusion bridges are particularly useful
  for image restoration, as the degraded images are structurally informative priors
  for reconstructing the clean images. I$^2$SB belongs to a tractable class of Schrödinger
  bridge, the nonlinear extension to score-based models, whose marginal distributions
  can be computed analytically given boundary pairs. This results in a simulation-free
  framework for nonlinear diffusions, where the I$^2$SB training becomes scalable
  by adopting practical techniques used in standard diffusion models. We validate
  I$^2$SB in solving various image restoration tasks, including inpainting, super-resolution,
  deblurring, and JPEG restoration on ImageNet 256$\times$256 and show that I$^2$SB
  surpasses standard conditional diffusion models with more interpretable generative
  processes. Moreover, I$^2$SB matches the performance of inverse methods that additionally
  require the knowledge of the corruption operators. Our work opens up new algorithmic
  opportunities for developing efficient nonlinear diffusion models on a large scale.
