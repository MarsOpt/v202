title: 'CodeIPPrompt: Intellectual Property Infringement Assessment of Code Language
  Models'
openreview: zdmbZl0ia6
abstract: 'Recent advances in large language models (LMs) have facilitated their ability
  to synthesize programming code. However, they have also raised concerns about intellectual
  property (IP) rights violations. Despite the significance of this issue, it has
  been relatively less explored. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap by presenting
  CodeIPPrompt, a platform for automatic evaluation of the extent to which code language
  models may reproduce licensed programs. It comprises two key components: prompts
  constructed from a licensed code database to elicit LMs to generate IP-violating
  code, and a measurement tool to evaluate the extent of IP violation of code LMs.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation of existing open-source code LMs and commercial
  products and revealed the prevalence of IP violations in all these models. We further
  identified that the root cause is the substantial proportion of training corpus
  subject to restrictive licenses, resulting from both intentional inclusion and inconsistent
  license practice in the real world. To address this issue, we also explored potential
  mitigation strategies, including fine-tuning and dynamic token filtering. Our study
  provides a testbed for evaluating the IP violation issues of the existing code generation
  platforms and stresses the need for a better mitigation strategy.'
