title: 'Pareto Manifold Learning: Tackling multiple tasks via ensembles of single-task
  models'
openreview: BUlx0rh7ha
abstract: In Multi-Task Learning (MTL), tasks may compete and limit the performance
  achieved on each other, rather than guiding the optimization to a solution, superior
  to all its single-task trained counterparts. Since there is often not a unique solution
  optimal for all tasks, practitioners have to balance tradeoffs between tasks’ performance,
  and resort to optimality in the Pareto sense. Most MTL methodologies either completely
  neglect this aspect, and instead of aiming at learning a Pareto Front, produce one
  solution predefined by their optimization schemes, or produce diverse but discrete
  solutions. Recent approaches parameterize the Pareto Front via neural networks,
  leading to complex mappings from tradeoff to objective space. In this paper, we
  conjecture that the Pareto Front admits a linear parameterization in parameter space,
  which leads us to propose <em>Pareto Manifold Learning</em>, an ensembling method
  in weight space. Our approach produces a continuous Pareto Front in a single training
  run, that allows to modulate the performance on each task during inference. Experiments
  on multi-task learning benchmarks, ranging from image classification to tabular
  datasets and scene understanding, show that <em>Pareto Manifold Learning</em> outperforms
  state-of-the-art single-point algorithms, while learning a better Pareto parameterization
  than multi-point baselines.
