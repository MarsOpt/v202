title: 'Constant Matters: Fine-grained Error Bound on Differentially Private Continual
  Observation'
openreview: Xqedp0Iu1S
abstract: We study fine-grained error bounds for differentially private algorithms
  for counting under continual observation. Our main insight is that the matrix mechanism
  when using lower-triangular matrices can be used in the continual observation model.
  More specifically, we give an explicit factorization for the counting matrix $M_\mathsf{count}$
  and upper bound the error explicitly. We also give a fine-grained analysis, specifying
  the exact constant in the upper bound. Our analysis is based on upper and lower
  bounds of the <em>completely bounded norm</em> (cb-norm) of $M_\mathsf{count}$.
  Along the way, we improve the best-known bound of 28 years by Mathias (SIAM Journal
  on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 1993) on the cb-norm of $M_\mathsf{count}$
  for a large range of the dimension of $M_\mathsf{count}$. Furthermore, we are the
  first to give concrete error bounds for various problems under continual observation
  such as binary counting, maintaining a histogram, releasing an approximately cut-preserving
  synthetic graph, many graph-based statistics, and substring and episode counting.
  Finally, we note that our result can be used to get a fine-grained error bound for
  non-interactive local learning and the first lower bounds on the additive error
  for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially-private counting under continual observation.
  Subsequent to this work, Henzinger et al. (SODA, 2023) showed that our factorization
  also achieves fine-grained mean-squared error.
