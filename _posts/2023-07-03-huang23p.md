title: Achieving Linear Speedup in Non-IID Federated Bilevel Learning
openreview: XFpTtAWNpQ
abstract: Federated bilevel learning has received increasing attention in various
  emerging machine learning and communication applications. Recently, several Hessian-vector-based
  algorithms have been proposed to solve the federated bilevel optimization problem.
  However, several important properties in federated learning such as the partial
  client participation and the linear speedup for convergence (i.e., the convergence
  rate and complexity are improved linearly with respect to the number of sampled
  clients) in the presence of non-i.i.d. datasets, still remain open. In this paper,
  we fill these gaps by proposing a new federated bilevel algorithm named FedMBO with
  a novel client sampling scheme in the federated hypergradient estimation. We show
  that FedMBO achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{nK}}+\frac{1}{K}+\frac{\sqrt{n}}{K^{3/2}}\big)$
  on non-i.i.d. datasets, where $n$ is the number of participating clients in each
  round, and $K$ is the total number of iteration. This is the first theoretical linear
  speedup result for non-i.i.d. federated bilevel optimization. Extensive experiments
  validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
  method.
