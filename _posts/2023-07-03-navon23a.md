title: Equivariant Architectures for Learning in Deep Weight Spaces
openreview: SCU1xlr9Y4
abstract: 'Designing machine learning architectures for processing neural networks
  in their raw weight matrix form is a newly introduced research direction. Unfortunately,
  the unique symmetry structure of deep weight spaces makes this design very challenging.
  If successful, such architectures would be capable of performing a wide range of
  intriguing tasks, from adapting a pre-trained network to a new domain to editing
  objects represented as functions (INRs or NeRFs). As a first step towards this goal,
  we present here a novel network architecture for learning in deep weight spaces.
  It takes as input a concatenation of weights and biases of a pre-trained MLP and
  processes it using a composition of layers that are equivariant to the natural permutation
  symmetry of the MLPâ€™s weights: Changing the order of neurons in intermediate layers
  of the MLP does not affect the function it represents. We provide a full characterization
  of all affine equivariant and invariant layers for these symmetries and show how
  these layers can be implemented using three basic operations: pooling, broadcasting,
  and fully connected layers applied to the input in an appropriate manner. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our architecture and its advantages over natural baselines
  in a variety of learning tasks.'
