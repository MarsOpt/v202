title: Uncertain Evidence in Probabilistic Models and Stochastic Simulators
openreview: qlAtMW9jIh
abstract: 'We consider the problem of performing Bayesian inference in probabilistic
  models where observations are accompanied by uncertainty, referred to as "uncertain
  evidence.” We explore how to interpret uncertain evidence, and by extension the
  importance of proper interpretation as it pertains to inference about latent variables.
  We consider a recently-proposed method "distributional evidence” as well as revisit
  two older methods: Jeffrey’s rule and virtual evidence. We devise guidelines on
  how to account for uncertain evidence and we provide new insights, particularly
  regarding consistency. To showcase the impact of different interpretations of the
  same uncertain evidence, we carry out experiments in which one interpretation is
  defined as "correct.” We then compare inference results from each different interpretation
  illustrating the importance of careful consideration of uncertain evidence.'
