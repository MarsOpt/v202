title: The Implicit Regularization of Dynamical Stability in Stochastic Gradient Descent
openreview: odBNsDyr4Q
abstract: In this paper, we study the implicit regularization of stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD) through the lens of <em>dynamical stability</em> (Wu et al., 2018).
  We start by revising existing stability analyses of SGD, showing how the Frobenius
  norm and trace of Hessian relate to different notions of stability. Notably, if
  a global minimum is linearly stable for SGD, then the trace of Hessian must be less
  than or equal to $2/\eta$, where $\eta$ denotes the learning rate. By contrast,
  for gradient descent (GD), the stability imposes a similar constraint but only on
  the largest eigenvalue of Hessian. We then turn to analyze the generalization properties
  of these stable minima, focusing specifically on two-layer ReLU networks and diagonal
  linear networks. Notably, we establish the <em>equivalence</em> between these metrics
  of sharpness and certain parameter norms for the two models, which allows us to
  show that the stable minima of SGD provably generalize well. By contrast, the stability-induced
  regularization of GD is provably too weak to ensure satisfactory generalization.
  This discrepancy provides an explanation of why SGD often generalizes better than
  GD. Note that the learning rate (LR) plays a pivotal role in the strength of stability-induced
  regularization. As the LR increases, the regularization effect becomes more pronounced,
  elucidating why SGD with a larger LR consistently demonstrates superior generalization
  capabilities. Additionally, numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical
  findings.
