title: A Universal Unbiased Method for Classification from Aggregate Observations
openreview: GmUUB5HuOe
abstract: In conventional supervised classification, true labels are required for
  individual instances. However, it could be prohibitive to collect the true labels
  for individual instances, due to privacy concerns or unaffordable annotation costs.
  This motivates the study on classification from aggregate observations (CFAO), where
  the supervision is provided to groups of instances, instead of individual instances.
  CFAO is a generalized learning framework that contains various learning problems,
  such as multiple-instance learning and learning from label proportions. The goal
  of this paper is to present a novel universal method of CFAO, which holds an unbiased
  estimator of the classification risk for arbitrary lossesâ€”previous research failed
  to achieve this goal. Practically, our method works by weighing the importance of
  each instance and each label in the group, which provides purified supervision for
  the classifier to learn. Theoretically, our proposed method not only guarantees
  the risk consistency due to the unbiased risk estimator but also can be compatible
  with arbitrary losses. Extensive experiments on various problems of CFAO demonstrate
  the superiority of our proposed method.
