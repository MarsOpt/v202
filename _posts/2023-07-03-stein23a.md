title: Partial Optimality in Cubic Correlation Clustering
openreview: kdrPtUAfNx
abstract: The higher-order correlation clustering problem is an expressive model,
  and recently, local search heuristics have been proposed for several applications.
  Certifying optimality, however, is NP-hard and practically hampered already by the
  complexity of the problem statement. Here, we focus on establishing partial optimality
  conditions for the special case of complete graphs and cubic objective functions.
  In addition, we define and implement algorithms for testing these conditions and
  examine their effect numerically, on two datasets.
