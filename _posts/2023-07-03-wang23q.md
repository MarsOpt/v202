title: 'Warm-Start Actor-Critic: From Approximation Error to Sub-optimality Gap'
openreview: p5ZMcFXKvm
abstract: Warm-Start reinforcement learning (RL), aided by a prior policy obtained
  from offline training, is emerging as a promising RL approach for practical applications.
  Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that the performance of Warm-Start RL
  can be improved <em>quickly</em> in some cases but become <em>stagnant</em> in other
  cases, especially when the function approximation is used. To this end, the primary
  objective of this work is to build a fundamental understanding on ”whether and when
  online learning can be significantly accelerated by a warm-start policy from offline
  RL?”. Specifically, we consider the widely used Actor-Critic (A-C) method with a
  prior policy. We first quantify the approximation errors in the Actor update and
  the Critic update, respectively. Next, we cast the Warm-Start A-C algorithm as Newton’s
  method with perturbation, and study the impact of the approximation errors on the
  finite-time learning performance with inaccurate Actor/Critic updates. Under some
  general technical conditions, we derive the upper bounds, which shed light on achieving
  the desired finite-learning performance in the Warm-Start A-C algorithm. In particular,
  our findings reveal that it is essential to reduce the algorithm bias in online
  learning. We also obtain lower bounds on the sub-optimality gap of the Warm-Start
  A-C algorithm to quantify the impact of the bias and error propagation.
