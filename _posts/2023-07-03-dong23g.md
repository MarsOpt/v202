title: Does Sparsity Help in Learning Misspecified Linear Bandits?
openreview: T6kFiVUOn2
abstract: Recently, the study of linear misspecified bandits has generated intriguing
  implications of the hardness of learning in bandits and reinforcement learning (RL).
  In particular, Du et al. (2020) shows that even if a learner is given linear features
  in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that approximate the rewards in a bandit or RL with a uniform
  error of $\varepsilon$, searching for an $O(\varepsilon)$-optimal action requires
  pulling at least $\Omega(\exp(d))$ queries. Furthermore, Lattimore et al. (2020)
  show that a degraded $O(\varepsilon\sqrt{d})$-optimal solution can be learned within
  $\operatorname{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ queries. Yet it is unknown whether a structural
  assumption on the ground-truth parameter, such as sparsity, could break $\varepsilon\sqrt{d}$
  barrier. In this paper, we address this question by showing that algorithms can
  obtain $O(\varepsilon)$-optimal actions by querying $\tilde{O}(\exp(m\varepsilon))$
  actions, where $m$ is the sparsity parameter, removing the $\exp(d)$-dependence.
  We further show (with an information-theoretical lower bound) that this is the best
  possible if one demands an error $ m^{\delta}\varepsilon$ for $0<\delta<1$. We further
  show that $\operatorname{poly}(m/\varepsilon)$ bounds are possible when the linear
  features are "good”. These results provide a nearly complete picture of how sparsity
  can help in misspecified bandit learning and provide a deeper understanding of when
  linear features are “useful” for bandit and reinforcement learning with misspecification.
