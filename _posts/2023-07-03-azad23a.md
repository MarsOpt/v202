title: 'CLUTR: Curriculum Learning via Unsupervised Task Representation Learning'
openreview: wagsJnR5GO
abstract: 'Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are often known for sample inefficiency
  and difficult generalization. Recently, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) emerged
  as a new paradigm for zero-shot generalization by simultaneously learning a task
  distribution and agent policies on the generated tasks. This is a non-stationary
  process where the task distribution evolves along with agent policies; creating
  an instability over time. While past works demonstrated the potential of such approaches,
  sampling effectively from the task space remains an open challenge, bottlenecking
  these approaches. To this end, we introduce CLUTR: a novel unsupervised curriculum
  learning algorithm that decouples task representation and curriculum learning into
  a two-stage optimization. It first trains a recurrent variational autoencoder on
  randomly generated tasks to learn a latent task manifold. Next, a teacher agent
  creates a curriculum by maximizing a minimax REGRET-based objective on a set of
  latent tasks sampled from this manifold. Using the fixed-pretrained task manifold,
  we show that CLUTR successfully overcomes the non-stationarity problem and improves
  stability. Our experimental results show CLUTR outperforms PAIRED, a principled
  and popular UED method, in the challenging CarRacing and navigation environments:
  achieving 10.6X and 45% improvement in zero-shot generalization, respectively. CLUTR
  also performs comparably to the non-UED state-of-the-art for CarRacing, while requiring
  500X fewer environment interactions. We open source our code at https://github.com/clutr/clutr.'
