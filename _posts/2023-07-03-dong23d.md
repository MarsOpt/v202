title: Diversity-enhancing Generative Network for Few-shot Hypothesis Adaptation
openreview: PJzjHAnoVp
abstract: 'Generating unlabeled data has been recently shown to help address the few-shot
  hypothesis adaptation (FHA) problem, where we aim to train a classifier for the
  target domain with a few labeled target-domain data and a well-trained source-domain
  classifier (i.e., a source hypothesis), for the additional information of the highly-compatible
  unlabeled data. However, the generated data of the existing methods are extremely
  similar or even the same. The strong dependency among the generated data will lead
  the learning to fail. In this paper, we propose a diversity-enhancing generative
  network (DEG-Net) for the FHA problem, which can generate diverse unlabeled data
  with the help of a kernel independence measure: the Hilbert-Schmidt independence
  criterion (HSIC). Specifically, DEG-Net will generate data via minimizing the HSIC
  value (i.e., maximizing the independence) among the semantic features of the generated
  data. By DEG-Net, the generated unlabeled data are more diverse and more effective
  for addressing the FHA problem. Experimental results show that the DEG-Net outperforms
  existing FHA baselines and further verifies that generating diverse data plays an
  important role in addressing the FHA problem.'
