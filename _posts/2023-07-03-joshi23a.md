title: On the Expressive Power of Geometric Graph Neural Networks
openreview: 6Ed3gchl9L
abstract: 'The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been studied extensively
  through the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test. However, standard GNNs
  and the WL framework are inapplicable for geometric graphs embedded in Euclidean
  space, such as biomolecules, materials, and other physical systems. In this work,
  we propose a geometric version of the WL test (GWL) for discriminating geometric
  graphs while respecting the underlying physical symmetries: permutations, rotation,
  reflection, and translation. We use GWL to characterise the expressive power of
  geometric GNNs that are invariant or equivariant to physical symmetries in terms
  of distinguishing geometric graphs. GWL unpacks how key design choices influence
  geometric GNN expressivity: (1) Invariant layers have limited expressivity as they
  cannot distinguish one-hop identical geometric graphs; (2) Equivariant layers distinguish
  a larger class of graphs by propagating geometric information beyond local neighbourhoods;
  (3) Higher order tensors and scalarisation enable maximally powerful geometric GNNs;
  and (4) GWLâ€™s discrimination-based perspective is equivalent to universal approximation.
