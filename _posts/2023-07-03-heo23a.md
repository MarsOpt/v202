title: Robust Camera Pose Refinement for Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding
openreview: O7lWozCqjT
abstract: Multi-resolution hash encoding has recently been proposed to reduce the
  computational cost of neural renderings, such as NeRF. This method requires accurate
  camera poses for the neural renderings of given scenes. However, contrary to previous
  methods jointly optimizing camera poses and 3D scenes, the naive gradient-based
  camera pose refinement method using multi-resolution hash encoding severely deteriorates
  performance. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to calibrate the camera pose
  and learn a geometric representation using efficient multi-resolution hash encoding.
  Showing that the oscillating gradient flows of hash encoding interfere with the
  registration of camera poses, our method addresses the issue by utilizing smooth
  interpolation weighting to stabilize the gradient oscillation for the ray samplings
  across hash grids. Moreover, the curriculum training procedure helps to learn the
  level-wise hash encoding, further increasing the pose refinement. Experiments on
  the novel-view synthesis datasets validate that our learning frameworks achieve
  state-of-the-art performance and rapid convergence of neural rendering.
