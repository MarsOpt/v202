title: Training Normalizing Flows from Dependent Data
openreview: GBmL22Gx9X
abstract: Normalizing flows are powerful non-parametric statistical models that function
  as a hybrid between density estimators and generative models. Current learning algorithms
  for normalizing flows assume that data points are sampled independently, an assumption
  that is frequently violated in practice, which may lead to erroneous density estimation
  and data generation. We propose a likelihood objective of normalizing flows incorporating
  dependencies between the data points, for which we derive a flexible and efficient
  learning algorithm suitable for different dependency structures. We show that respecting
  dependencies between observations can improve empirical results on both synthetic
  and real-world data, and leads to higher statistical power in a downstream application
  to genome-wide association studies.
