title: Rethinking Backdoor Attacks
openreview: V0ydUD8aW4
abstract: 'In a <em>backdoor attack</em>, an adversary inserts maliciously constructed
  backdoor examples into a training set to make the resulting model vulnerable to
  manipulation. Defending against such attacks involves viewing inserted examples
  as outliers in the training set and using techniques from robust statistics to detect
  and remove them. In this work, we present a different approach to the backdoor attack
  problem. Specifically, we show that without structural information about the training
  data distribution, backdoor attacks are <em>indistinguishable</em> from naturally-occuring
  features in the dataâ€”and thus impossible to "detect" in a general sense. Then, guided
  by this observation, we revisit existing defenses against backdoor attacks and characterize
  the (often latent) assumptions they make, and on which they depend. Finally, we
  explore an alternative perspective on backdoor attacks: one that assumes these attacks
  correspond to the <em>strongest</em> feature in the training data. Under this assumption
  (which we make formal) we develop a new primitive for detecting backdoor attacks.
  Our primitive naturally gives rise to a detection algorithm that comes with theoretical
  guarantees, and is effective in practice.'
