title: 'Hyperbolic Representation Learning: Revisiting and Advancing'
openreview: 9CZZ8tIhSv
abstract: The non-Euclidean geometry of hyperbolic spaces has recently garnered considerable
  attention in the realm of representation learning. Current endeavors in hyperbolic
  representation largely presuppose that the underlying hierarchies can be automatically
  inferred and preserved through the adaptive optimization process. This assumption,
  however, is questionable and requires further validation. In this work, we first
  introduce a position-tracking mechanism to scrutinize existing prevalent hyperbolic
  models, revealing that the learned representations are sub-optimal and unsatisfactory.
  To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, hyperbolic informed embedding
  (HIE), by incorporating cost-free hierarchical information deduced from the hyperbolic
  distance of the node to the origin (i.e., induced hyperbolic norm) to advance existing
  hyperbolic models. The proposed method HIE is both task-agnostic and model-agnostic,
  enabling its seamless integration with a broad spectrum of models and tasks. Extensive
  experiments across various models and different tasks demonstrate the versatility
  and adaptability of the proposed method. Remarkably, our method achieves a remarkable
  improvement of up to 21.4% compared to the competing baselines.
