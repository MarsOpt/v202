title: Counterfactual Identifiability of Bijective Causal Models
openreview: 4KeshY2gzB
abstract: We study counterfactual identifiability in causal models with bijective
  generation mechanisms (BGM), a class that generalizes several widely-used causal
  models in the literature. We establish their counterfactual identifiability for
  three common causal structures with unobserved confounding, and propose a practical
  learning method that casts learning a BGM as structured generative modeling. Learned
  BGMs enable efficient counterfactual estimation and can be obtained using a variety
  of deep conditional generative models. We evaluate our techniques in a visual task
  and demonstrate its application in a real-world video streaming simulation task.
