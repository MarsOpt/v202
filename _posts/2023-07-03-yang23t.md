title: Continual Task Allocation in Meta-Policy Network via Sparse Prompting
openreview: IqI8074rFu
abstract: 'How to train a generalizable meta-policy by continually learning a sequence
  of tasks? It is a natural human skill yet challenging to achieve by current reinforcement
  learning: the agent is expected to quickly adapt to new tasks (plasticity) meanwhile
  retaining the common knowledge from previous tasks (stability). We address it by
  "Continual Task Allocation via Sparse Prompting (CoTASP)", which learns over-complete
  dictionaries to produce sparse masks as prompts extracting a sub-network for each
  task from a meta-policy network. CoTASP trains a policy for each task by optimizing
  the prompts and the sub-network weights alternatively. The dictionary is then updated
  to align the optimized prompts with tasks’ embedding, thereby capturing tasks’ semantic
  correlations. Hence, relevant tasks share more neurons in the meta-policy network
  due to similar prompts while cross-task interference causing forgetting is effectively
  restrained. Given a meta-policy and dictionaries trained on previous tasks, new
  task adaptation reduces to highly efficient sparse prompting and sub-network finetuning.
  In experiments, CoTASP achieves a promising plasticity-stability trade-off without
  storing or replaying any past tasks’ experiences. It outperforms existing continual
  and multi-task RL methods on all seen tasks, forgetting reduction, and generalization
  to unseen tasks.'
