title: 'AbODE: Ab initio antibody design using conjoined ODEs'
openreview: EB5unD2ojL
abstract: Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that neutralize pathogens and constitute
  the core of our adaptive immune system. De novo generation of new antibodies that
  target specific antigens holds the key to accelerating vaccine discovery. However,
  this co-design of the amino acid sequence and the 3D structure subsumes and accentuates,
  some central challenges from multiple tasks including protein folding (sequence
  to structure), inverse folding (structure to sequence), and docking (binding). We
  strive to surmount these challenges with a new generative model AbODE that extends
  graph PDEs to accommodate both contextual information and external interactions.
  Unlike existing approaches, AbODE uses a single round of full-shot decoding, and
  elicits continuous differential attention that encapsulates, and evolves with, latent
  interactions within the antibody as well as those involving the antigen. We unravel
  fundamental connections between AbODE and temporal networks as well as graph-matching
  networks. The proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods on standard
  metrics across benchmarks.
