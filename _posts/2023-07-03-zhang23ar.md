title: Provable Dynamic Fusion for Low-Quality Multimodal Data
openreview: 2MF4aDRfiE
abstract: The inherent challenge of multimodal fusion is to precisely capture the
  cross-modal correlation and flexibly conduct cross-modal interaction. To fully release
  the value of each modality and mitigate the influence of low-quality multimodal
  data, dynamic multimodal fusion emerges as a promising learning paradigm. Despite
  its widespread use, theoretical justifications in this field are still notably lacking.
  Can we design a provably robust multimodal fusion method? This paper provides theoretical
  understandings to answer this question under a most popular multimodal fusion framework
  from the generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal that several uncertainty
  estimation solutions are naturally available to achieve robust multimodal fusion.
  Then a novel multimodal fusion framework termed Quality-aware Multimodal Fusion
  (QMF) is proposed, which can improve the performance in terms of classification
  accuracy and model robustness. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks
  can support our findings.
