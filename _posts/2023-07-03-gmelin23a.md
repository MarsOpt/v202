title: Efficient RL via Disentangled Environment and Agent Representations
openreview: kWS8mpioS9
abstract: Agents that are aware of the separation between the environments and themselves
  can leverage this understanding to form effective representations of visual input.
  We propose an approach for learning such structured representations for RL algorithms,
  using visual knowledge of the agent, which is often inexpensive to obtain, such
  as its shape or mask. This is incorporated into the RL objective using a simple
  auxiliary loss. We show that our method, SEAR (Structured Environment-Agent Representations),
  outperforms state-of-the-art model-free approaches over 18 different challenging
  visual simulation environments spanning 5 different robots.
