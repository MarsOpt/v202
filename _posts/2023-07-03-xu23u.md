title: Bayesian Design Principles for Frequentist Sequential Learning
openreview: tRhQsHnoFw
abstract: We develop a general theory to optimize the frequentist regret for sequential
  learning problems, where efficient bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms
  can be derived from unified Bayesian principles. We propose a novel optimization
  approach to create "algorithmic beliefs" at each round, and use Bayesian posteriors
  to make decisions. This is the first approach to make Bayesian-type algorithms prior-free
  and applicable to adversarial settings, in a generic and optimal manner. Moreover,
  the algorithms are simple and often efficient to implement. As a major application,
  we present a novel algorithm for multi-armed bandits that achieves the "best-of-all-worlds"
  empirical performance in the stochastic, adversarial, and non-stationary environments.
  And we illustrate how these principles can be used in linear bandits, convex bandits,
  and reinforcement learning.
