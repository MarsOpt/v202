title: Conformal Prediction Sets for Graph Neural Networks
openreview: zGf8J0bNfX
abstract: Despite the widespread use of graph neural networks (GNNs) we lack methods
  to reliably quantify their uncertainty. We propose a conformal procedure to equip
  GNNs with prediction sets that come with distribution-free guarantees â€“ the output
  set contains the true label with arbitrarily high probability. Our post-processing
  procedure can wrap around any (pretrained) GNN, and unlike existing methods, results
  in meaningful sets even when the model provides only the top class. The key idea
  is to diffuse the node-wise conformity scores to incorporate neighborhood information.
  By leveraging the network homophily we construct sets with comparable or better
  efficiency (average size) and significantly improved singleton hit ratio (correct
  sets of size one). In addition to an extensive empirical evaluation, we investigate
  the theoretical conditions under which smoothing provably improves efficiency.
