title: Learning Mixtures of Gaussians with Censored Data
openreview: MA5yCdi2LK
abstract: We study the problem of learning mixtures of Gaussians with censored data.
  Statistical learning with censored data is a classical problem, with numerous practical
  applications, however, finite-sample guarantees for even simple latent variable
  models such as Gaussian mixtures are missing. Formally, we are given censored data
  from a mixture of univariate Gaussians $ \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma^2),
  $ i.e. the sample is observed only if it lies inside a set $S$. The goal is to learn
  the weights $w_i$ and the means $\mu_i$. We propose an algorithm that takes only
  $\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{O(k)}}$ samples to estimate the weights $w_i$ and the means
  $\mu_i$ within $\varepsilon$ error.
