title: 'Not All Semantics are Created Equal: Contrastive Self-supervised Learning
  with Automatic Temperature Individualization'
openreview: slM2r4bRD1
abstract: In this paper, we aim to optimize a contrastive loss with individualized
  temperatures in a principled manner. The common practice of using a global temperature
  parameter $\tau$ ignores the fact that â€œnot all semantics are created equal", meaning
  that different anchor data may have different numbers of samples with similar semantics,
  especially when data exhibits long-tails. First, we propose a new robust contrastive
  loss inspired by distributionally robust optimization (DRO), providing us an intuition
  about the effect of $\tau$ and a mechanism for automatic temperature individualization.
  Then, we propose an efficient stochastic algorithm for optimizing the robust contrastive
  loss with a provable convergence guarantee without using large mini-batch sizes.
  Theoretical and experimental results show that our algorithm automatically learns
  a suitable $\tau$ for each sample. Specifically, samples with frequent semantics
  use large temperatures to keep local semantic structures, while samples with rare
  semantics use small temperatures to induce more separable features. Our method not
  only outperforms prior strong baselines (e.g., SimCLR, CLIP) on unimodal and bimodal
  tasks with larger improvements on imbalanced data but also is less sensitive to
  hyper-parameters. To our best knowledge, this is the first methodical approach to
  optimizing a contrastive loss with individualized temperatures. Our proposed algorithms
  are implemented in the LibAUC library at https://libauc.org.
