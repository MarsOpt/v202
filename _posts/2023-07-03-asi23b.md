title: From Robustness to Privacy and Back
openreview: 9viDfxnY3q
abstract: We study the relationship between two desiderata of algorithms in statistical
  inference and machine learningâ€”differential privacy and robustness to adversarial
  data corruptions. Their conceptual similarity was first observed by Dwork and Lei
  (STOC 2009), who observed that private algorithms satisfy robustness, and gave a
  general method for converting robust algorithms to private ones. However, all general
  methods for transforming robust algorithms into private ones lead to suboptimal
  error rates. Our work gives the first black-box transformation that converts any
  adversarially robust algorithm into one that satisfies pure differential privacy.
  Moreover, we show that for any low-dimensional estimation task, applying our transformation
  to an optimal robust estimator results in an optimal private estimator. Thus, we
  conclude that for any low-dimensional task, the optimal error rate for $\varepsilon$-differentially
  private estimators is essentially the same as the optimal error rate for estimators
  that are robust to adversarially corrupting $1/\varepsilon$ training samples. We
  apply our transformation to obtain new optimal private estimators for several high-dimensional
  statistical tasks, including Gaussian linear regression and PCA. Finally, we present
  an extension of our transformation that leads to approximately differentially private
  algorithms whose error does not depend on the range of the output space, which is
  impossible under pure differential privacy.
