title: Theoretical Bounds on the Network Community Profile from Low-rank Semi-definite
  Programming
openreview: 6EUqA8VZ2O
abstract: We study a new connection between a technical measure called $\mu$-conductance
  that arises in the study of Markov chains for sampling convex bodies and the network
  community profile that characterizes size-resolved properties of clusters and communities
  in social and information networks. The idea of $\mu$-conductance is similar to
  the traditional graph conductance, but disregards sets with small volume. We derive
  a sequence of optimization problems including a low-rank semi-definite program from
  which we can derive a lower bound on the optimal $\mu$-conductance value. These
  ideas give the first theoretically sound bound on the behavior of the network community
  profile for a wide range of cluster sizes. The algorithm scales up to graphs with
  hundreds of thousands of nodes and we demonstrate how our framework validates the
  predicted structures of real-world graphs.
