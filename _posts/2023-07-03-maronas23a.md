title: Efficient Transformed Gaussian Processes for Non-Stationary Dependent Multi-class
  Classification
openreview: OvFjnqxmuo
abstract: 'This work introduces the Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process (ETGP),
  a new way of creating $C$ stochastic processes characterized by: 1) the $C$ processes
  are non-stationary, 2) the $C$ processes are dependent by construction without needing
  a mixing matrix, 3) training and making predictions is very efficient since the
  number of Gaussian Processes (GP) operations (e.g. inverting the inducing point’s
  covariance matrix) do not depend on the number of processes. This makes the ETGP
  particularly suited for multi-class problems with a very large number of classes,
  which are the problems studied in this work. ETGP exploits the recently proposed
  Transformed Gaussian Process (TGP), a stochastic process specified by transforming
  a Gaussian Process using an invertible transformation. However, unlike TGP, ETGP
  is constructed by transforming a single sample from a GP using $C$ invertible transformations.
  We derive an efficient sparse variational inference algorithm for the proposed model
  and demonstrate its utility in 5 classification tasks which include low/medium/large
  datasets and a different number of classes, ranging from just a few to hundreds.
  Our results show that ETGP, in general, outperforms state-of-the-art methods for
  multi-class classification based on GPs, and has a lower computational cost (around
  one order of magnitude smaller).'
