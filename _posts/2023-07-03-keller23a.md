title: 'Neural Wave Machines: Learning Spatiotemporally Structured Representations
  with Locally Coupled Oscillatory Recurrent Neural Networks'
openreview: 5tJSt3kn4s
abstract: Traveling waves have been measured at a diversity of regions and scales
  in the brain, however a consensus as to their computational purpose has yet to be
  reached. An intriguing hypothesis is that traveling waves serve to structure neural
  representations both in space and time, thereby acting as an inductive bias towards
  natural data. In this work, we investigate this hypothesis by introducing the Neural
  Wave Machine (NWM) â€“ a locally coupled oscillatory recurrent neural network capable
  of exhibiting traveling waves in its hidden state. After training on simple dynamic
  sequences, we show that this model indeed learns static spatial structure such as
  topographic organization, and further uses complex spatiotemporal structure such
  as traveling waves to encode observed transformations. To measure the computational
  implications of this structure, we use a suite of sequence classification and physical
  dynamics modeling tasks to show that the NWM is both more parameter efficient, and
  is able to forecast future trajectories of simple physical dynamical systems more
  accurately than existing state of the art counterparts.
