title: 'Sketched Ridgeless Linear Regression: The Role of Downsampling'
openreview: WmAfdffvfe
abstract: Overparametrization often helps improve the generalization performance.
  This paper presents a dual view of overparametrization suggesting that downsampling
  may also help generalize. Focusing on the proportional regime $m\asymp n \asymp
  p$, where $m$ represents the sketching size, $n$ is the sample size, and $p$ is
  the feature dimensionality, we investigate two out-of-sample prediction risks of
  the sketched ridgeless least square estimator. Our findings challenge conventional
  beliefs by showing that downsampling does not always harm generalization but can
  actually improve it in certain cases. We identify the optimal sketching size that
  minimizes out-of-sample prediction risks and demonstrate that the optimally sketched
  estimator exhibits stabler risk curves, eliminating the peaks of those for the full-sample
  estimator. To facilitate practical implementation, we propose an empirical procedure
  to determine the optimal sketching size. Finally, we extend our analysis to cover
  central limit theorems and misspecified models. Numerical studies strongly support
  our theory.
