title: Adversarially Robust PAC Learnability of Real-Valued Functions
openreview: fcDq3BIbe9
abstract: We study robustness to test-time adversarial attacks in the regression setting
  with $\ell_p$ losses and arbitrary perturbation sets. We address the question of
  which function classes are PAC learnable in this setting. We show that classes of
  finite fat-shattering dimension are learnable in both the realizable and agnostic
  settings. Moreover, for convex function classes, they are even properly learnable.
  In contrast, some non-convex function classes provably require improper learning
  algorithms. Our main technique is based on a construction of an adversarially robust
  sample compression scheme of a size determined by the fat-shattering dimension.
  Along the way, we introduce a novel agnostic sample compression scheme for real-valued
  functions, which may be of independent interest.
