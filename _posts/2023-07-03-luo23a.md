title: 'SegCLIP: Patch Aggregation with Learnable Centers for Open-Vocabulary Semantic
  Segmentation'
openreview: uhcNmiPjDm
abstract: Recently, the contrastive language-image pre-training, e.g., CLIP, has demonstrated
  promising results on various downstream tasks. The pre-trained model can capture
  enriched visual concepts for images by learning from a large scale of text-image
  data. However, transferring the learned visual knowledge to open-vocabulary semantic
  segmentation is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a CLIP-based model
  named SegCLIP for the topic of open-vocabulary segmentation in an annotation-free
  manner. The SegCLIP achieves segmentation based on ViT and the main idea is to gather
  patches with learnable centers to semantic regions through training on text-image
  pairs. The gathering operation can dynamically capture the semantic groups, which
  can be used to generate the final segmentation results. We further propose a reconstruction
  loss on masked patches and a superpixel-based KL loss with pseudo-labels to enhance
  the visual representation. Experimental results show that our model achieves comparable
  or superior segmentation accuracy on the PASCAL VOC 2012 (+0.3% mIoU), PASCAL Context
  (+2.3% mIoU), and COCO (+2.2% mIoU) compared with baselines. We release the code
  at https://github.com/ArrowLuo/SegCLIP.
