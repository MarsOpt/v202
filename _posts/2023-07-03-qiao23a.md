title: Collaborative Causal Inference with Fair Incentives
openreview: Y7zfCfnax4
abstract: Collaborative causal inference (CCI) aims to improve the estimation of the
  causal effect of treatment variables by utilizing data aggregated from multiple
  self-interested parties. Since their source data are valuable proprietary assets
  that can be costly or tedious to obtain, every party has to be incentivized to be
  willing to contribute to the collaboration, such as with a guaranteed fair and sufficiently
  valuable reward (than performing causal inference on its own). This paper presents
  a reward scheme designed using the unique statistical properties that are required
  by causal inference to guarantee certain desirable incentive criteria (e.g., fairness,
  benefit) for the parties based on their contributions. To achieve this, we propose
  a data valuation function to value parties’ data for CCI based on the distributional
  closeness of its resulting treatment effect estimate to that utilizing the aggregated
  data from all parties. Then, we show how to value the parties’ rewards fairly based
  on a modified variant of the Shapley value arising from our proposed data valuation
  for CCI. Finally, the Shapley fair rewards to the parties are realized in the form
  of improved, stochastically perturbed treatment effect estimates. We empirically
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our reward scheme using simulated and real-world
  datasets.
