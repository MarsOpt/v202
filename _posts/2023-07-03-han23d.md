title: 'System Identification of Neural Systems: If We Got It Right, Would We Know?'
openreview: NkTEhPQCjg
abstract: Artificial neural networks are being proposed as models of parts of the
  brain. The networks are compared to recordings of biological neurons, and good performance
  in reproducing neural responses is considered to support the modelâ€™s validity. A
  key question is how much this system identification approach tells us about brain
  computation. Does it validate one model architecture over another? We evaluate the
  most commonly used comparison techniques, such as a linear encoding model and centered
  kernel alignment, to correctly identify a model by replacing brain recordings with
  known ground truth models. System identification performance is quite variable;
  it also depends significantly on factors independent of the ground truth architecture,
  such as stimuli images. In addition, we show the limitations of using functional
  similarity scores in identifying higher-level architectural motifs.
