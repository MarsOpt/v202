title: Graph Switching Dynamical Systems
openreview: rW6ENT7EtX
abstract: Dynamical systems with complex behaviours, e.g. immune system cells interacting
  with a pathogen, are commonly modelled by splitting the behaviour in different regimes,
  or <em>modes</em>, each with simpler dynamics, and then learn the switching behaviour
  from one mode to another. To achieve this, Switching Dynamical Systems (SDS) are
  a powerful tool that automatically discovers these modes and mode-switching behaviour
  from time series data. While effective, these methods focus on <em>independent objects</em>,
  where the modes of one object are independent of the modes of the other objects.
  In this paper, we focus on the more general <em>interacting object</em> setting
  for switching dynamical systems, where the per-object dynamics also depend on an
  unknown and dynamically changing subset of other objects and their modes. To this
  end, we propose a novel graph-based approach for switching dynamical systems, GRAph
  Switching dynamical Systems (GRASS), in which we use a dynamic graph to characterize
  interactions between objects and learn both intra-object and inter-object mode-switching
  behaviour. For benchmarking, we create two new datasets, a synthesized ODE-driven
  particles dataset and a real-world Salsa-couple dancing dataset. Experiments show
  that GRASS can consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. We will
  release code and data after acceptance.
