title: Short-lived High-volume Bandits
openreview: W5xbQluQ5d
abstract: Modern platforms leverage randomized experiments to make informed decisions
  from a given set of alternatives. As a particularly challenging scenario, these
  alternatives can potentially have (i) high volume, with thousands of new items being
  released each hour, and (ii) short lifetime, either due to the contentsâ€™ transient
  nature, or some underlying non-stationarity that impels the learner to treat the
  same item as non-identical copies across time. We consider a multiplay bandits model.
  In each round a set of $k=n^\rho$ actions that will be available for $w$ rounds
  arrives, each of whose mean reward is drawn from a fixed known distribution. The
  learner selects a multiset of $n$ actions at a time. We propose an $\ell$-Layered
  Sieve Policy that recursively refines the action space for $\ell\leq w$ times. We
  show that for any given $\rho>0$, with suitable $\ell$, the policy achieves $\tilde
  O (n^{-\min \{\rho, \frac 12 (1+\frac 1w)^{-1}\}})$ regret. We also complement this
  result with an $\Omega (n^{-\min \{\rho, \frac 12\}})$ lower bound. We further validate
  the effectiveness of our Sieve Policy via numerical simulations and a field experiment
  in a large content card serving platform.
