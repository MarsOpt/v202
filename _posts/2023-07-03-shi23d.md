title: Improving the Model Consistency of Decentralized Federated Learning
openreview: fn2NFlYLBL
abstract: To mitigate the privacy leakages and communication burdens of Federated
  Learning (FL), decentralized FL (DFL) discards the central server and each client
  only communicates with its neighbors in a decentralized communication network. However,
  existing DFL suffers from high inconsistency among local clients, which results
  in severe distribution shift and inferior performance compared with centralized
  FL (CFL), especially on heterogeneous data or sparse communication topologies. To
  alleviate this issue, we propose two DFL algorithms named DFedSAM and DFedSAM-MGS
  to improve the performance of DFL. Specifically, DFedSAM leverages gradient perturbation
  to generate local flat models via Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), which searches
  for models with uniformly low loss values. DFedSAM-MGS further boosts DFedSAM by
  adopting Multiple Gossip Steps (MGS) for better model consistency, which accelerates
  the aggregation of local flat models and better balances communication complexity
  and generalization. Theoretically, we present improved convergence rates $\small
  \mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{KT}}+\frac{1}{T}+\frac{1}{K^{1/2}T^{3/2}(1-\lambda)^2}\big)$
  and $\small \mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{KT}}+\frac{1}{T}+\frac{\lambda^Q+1}{K^{1/2}T^{3/2}(1-\lambda^Q)^2}\big)$
  in non-convex setting for DFedSAM and DFedSAM-MGS, respectively, where $1-\lambda$
  is the spectral gap of gossip matrix and $Q$ is the number of MGS. Empirically,
  our methods can achieve competitive performance compared with CFL methods and outperform
  existing DFL methods.
