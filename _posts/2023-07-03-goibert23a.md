title: 'Robust Consensus in Ranking Data Analysis: Definitions, Properties and Computational
  Issues'
openreview: aIEL5ht9Sx
abstract: As the issue of robustness in AI systems becomes vital, statistical learning
  techniques that are reliable even in presence of partly contaminated data have to
  be developed. Preference data, in the form of (complete) rankings in the simplest
  situations, are no exception and the demand for appropriate concepts and tools is
  all the more pressing given that technologies fed by or producing this type of data
  ($\textit{e.g.}$ search engines, recommending systems) are now massively deployed.
  However, the lack of vector space structure for the set of rankings ($\textit{i.e.}$
  the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$) and the complex nature of statistics considered
  in ranking data analysis make the formulation of robustness objectives in this domain
  challenging. In this paper, we introduce notions of robustness, together with dedicated
  statistical methods, for $\textit{Consensus Ranking}$ the flagship problem in ranking
  data analysis, aiming at summarizing a probability distribution on $\mathfrak{S}_n$
  by a $\textit{median}$ ranking. Precisely, we propose specific extensions of the
  popular concept of <em>breakdown point</em>, tailored to consensus ranking, and
  address the related computational issues. Beyond the theoretical contributions,
  the relevance of the approach proposed is supported by an experimental study.
