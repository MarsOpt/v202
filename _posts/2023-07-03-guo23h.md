title: Hierarchical Grammar-Induced Geometry for Data-Efficient Molecular Property
  Prediction
openreview: G3vwtUqvrk
abstract: 'The prediction of molecular properties is a crucial task in the field of
  material and drug discovery. The potential benefits of using deep learning techniques
  are reflected in the wealth of recent literature. Still, these techniques are faced
  with a common challenge in practice: Labeled data are limited by the cost of manual
  extraction from literature and laborious experimentation. In this work, we propose
  a data-efficient property predictor by utilizing a learnable hierarchical molecular
  grammar that can generate molecules from grammar production rules. Such a grammar
  induces an explicit geometry of the space of molecular graphs, which provides an
  informative prior on molecular structural similarity. The property prediction is
  performed using graph neural diffusion over the grammar-induced geometry. On both
  small and large datasets, our evaluation shows that this approach outperforms a
  wide spectrum of baselines, including supervised and pre-trained graph neural networks.
  We include a detailed ablation study and further analysis of our solution, showing
  its effectiveness in cases with extremely limited data.'
