title: Multi-Task Differential Privacy Under Distribution Skew
openreview: f69OtekDi4
abstract: We study the problem of multi-task learning under user-level differential
  privacy, in which n users contribute data to m tasks, each involving a subset of
  users. One important aspect of the problem, that can significantly impact quality,
  is the distribution skew among tasks. Tasks that have much fewer data samples than
  others are more susceptible to the noise added for privacy. It is natural to ask
  whether algorithms can adapt to this skew to improve the overall utility. We give
  a systematic analysis of the problem, by studying how to optimally allocate a userâ€™s
  privacy budget among tasks. We propose a generic algorithm, based on an adaptive
  reweighting of the empirical loss, and show that in the presence of distribution
  skew, this gives a quantifiable improvement of excess empirical risk. Experimental
  studies on recommendation problems that exhibit a long tail of small tasks, demonstrate
  that our methods significantly improve utility, achieving the state of the art on
  two standard benchmarks.
