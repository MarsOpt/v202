title: Improving Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Propagation Operators
openreview: 5jFy5MQvUj
abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited in their propagation operators.
  In many cases, these operators often contain non-negative elements only and are
  shared across channels, limiting the expressiveness of GNNs. Moreover, some GNNs
  suffer from over-smoothing, limiting their depth. On the other hand, Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn diverse propagation filters, and phenomena like
  over-smoothing are typically not apparent in CNNs. In this paper, we bridge these
  gaps by incorporating trainable channel-wise weighting factors $\omega$ to learn
  and mix multiple smoothing and sharpening propagation operators at each layer. Our
  generic method is called $\omega$GNN, and is easy to implement. We study two variants:
  $\omega$GCN and $\omega$GAT. For $\omega$GCN, we theoretically analyse its behaviour
  and the impact of $\omega$ on the obtained node features. Our experiments confirm
  these findings, demonstrating and explaining how both variants do not over-smooth.
  Additionally, we experiment with 15 real-world datasets on node- and graph-classification
  tasks, where our $\omega$GCN and $\omega$GAT perform on par with state-of-the-art
  methods.'
