title: 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Compositional Generation with Energy-Based Diffusion
  Models and MCMC'
openreview: lAXwXjSYum
abstract: Since their introduction, diffusion models have quickly become the prevailing
  approach to generative modeling in many domains. They can be interpreted as learning
  the gradients of a time-varying sequence of log-probability density functions. This
  interpretation has motivated classifier-based and classifier-free guidance as methods
  for post-hoc control of diffusion models. In this work, we build upon these ideas
  using the score-based interpretation of diffusion models, and explore alternative
  ways to condition, modify, and reuse diffusion models for tasks involving compositional
  generation and guidance. In particular, we investigate why certain types of composition
  fail using current techniques and present a number of solutions. We conclude that
  the sampler (not the model) is responsible for this failure and propose new samplers,
  inspired by MCMC, which enable successful compositional generation. Further, we
  propose an energy-based parameterization of diffusion models which enables the use
  of new compositional operators and more sophisticated, Metropolis-corrected samplers.
  Intriguingly we find these samplers lead to notable improvements in compositional
  generation across a wide variety of problems such as classifier-guided ImageNet
  modeling and compositional text-to-image generation.
