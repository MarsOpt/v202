title: Who Needs to Know? Minimal Knowledge for Optimal Coordination
openreview: i8TF1Mrwcw
abstract: 'To optimally coordinate with others in cooperative games, it is often crucial
  to have information about oneâ€™s collaborators: successful driving requires understanding
  which side of the road to drive on. However, not every feature of collaborators
  is strategically relevant: the fine-grained acceleration of drivers may be ignored
  while maintaining optimal coordination. We show that there is a well-defined dichotomy
  between strategically relevant and irrelevant information. Moreover, we show that,
  in dynamic games, this dichotomy has a compact representation that can be efficiently
  computed via a Bellman backup operator. We apply this algorithm to analyze the strategically
  relevant information for tasks in both a standard and a partially observable version
  of the Overcooked environment. Theoretical and empirical results show that our algorithms
  are significantly more efficient than baselines. Videos are available at https://minknowledge.github.io.'
