title: Counterfactual Analysis in Dynamic Latent State Models
openreview: QiMkzvIZsI
abstract: We provide an optimization-based framework to perform counterfactual analysis
  in a dynamic model with hidden states. Our framework is grounded in the “abduction,
  action, and prediction” approach to answer counterfactual queries and handles two
  key challenges where (1) the states are hidden and (2) the model is dynamic. Recognizing
  the lack of knowledge on the underlying causal mechanism and the possibility of
  infinitely many such mechanisms, we optimize over this space and compute upper and
  lower bounds on the counterfactual quantity of interest. Our work brings together
  ideas from causality, state-space models, simulation, and optimization, and we apply
  it on a breast cancer case study. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
  to compute lower and upper bounds on a counterfactual query in a dynamic latent-state
  model.
