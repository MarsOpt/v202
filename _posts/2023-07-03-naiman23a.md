title: 'Sample and Predict Your Latent: Modality-free Sequential Disentanglement via
  Contrastive Estimation'
openreview: t1ZPGMHyWL
abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement is a long-standing challenge in representation
  learning. Recently, self-supervised techniques achieved impressive results in the
  sequential setting, where data is time-dependent. However, the latter methods employ
  modality-based data augmentations and random sampling or solve auxiliary tasks.
  In this work, we propose to avoid that by generating, sampling, and comparing empirical
  distributions from the underlying variational model. Unlike existing work, we introduce
  a self-supervised sequential disentanglement framework based on contrastive estimation
  with no external signals, while using common batch sizes and samples from the latent
  space itself. In practice, we propose a unified, efficient, and easy-to-code sampling
  strategy for semantically similar and dissimilar views of the data. We evaluate
  our approach on video, audio, and time series benchmarks. Our method presents state-of-the-art
  results in comparison to existing techniques. The code is available at https://github.com/azencot-group/SPYL.
