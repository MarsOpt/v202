title: Consistency Models
openreview: FmqFfMTNnv
abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the fields of image, audio,
  and video generation, but they depend on an iterative sampling process that causes
  slow generation. To overcome this limitation, we propose consistency models, a new
  family of models that generate high quality samples by directly mapping noise to
  data. They support fast one-step generation by design, while still allowing multistep
  sampling to trade compute for sample quality. They also support zero-shot data editing,
  such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution, without requiring
  explicit training on these tasks. Consistency models can be trained either by distilling
  pre-trained diffusion models, or as standalone generative models altogether. Through
  extensive experiments, we demonstrate that they outperform existing distillation
  techniques for diffusion models in one- and few-step sampling, achieving the new
  state-of-the-art FID of 3.55 on CIFAR-10 and 6.20 on ImageNet 64x64 for one-step
  generation. When trained in isolation, consistency models become a new family of
  generative models that can outperform existing one-step, non-adversarial generative
  models on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, ImageNet 64x64 and LSUN 256x256.
