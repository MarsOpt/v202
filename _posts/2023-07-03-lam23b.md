title: 'LegendreTron: Uprising Proper Multiclass Loss Learning'
openreview: uSHBQdWmuC
abstract: Loss functions serve as the foundation of supervised learning and are often
  chosen prior to model development. To avoid potentially ad hoc choices of losses,
  statistical decision theory describes a desirable property for losses known as <em>properness</em>,
  which asserts that Bayesâ€™ rule is optimal. Recent works have sought to <em>learn
  losses</em> and models jointly. Existing methods do this by fitting an inverse canonical
  link function which monotonically maps $\mathbb{R}$ to $[0,1]$ to estimate probabilities
  for binary problems. In this paper, we extend monotonicity to maps between $\mathbb{R}^{C-1}$
  and the projected probability simplex $\tilde{\Delta}^{C-1}$ by using monotonicity
  of gradients of convex functions. We present LegendreTron as a novel and practical
  method that jointly learns <em>proper canonical losses</em> and probabilities for
  multiclass problems. Tested on a benchmark of domains with up to 1,000 classes,
  our experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms the natural
  multiclass baseline under a $t$-test at 99% significance on all datasets with greater
  than $10$ classes.
