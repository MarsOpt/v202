title: Trapdoor Normalization with Irreversible Ownership Verification
openreview: f5DtfMCQiQ
abstract: 'This paper introduces a deep model watermark with an irreversible ownership
  verification scheme: Trapdoor Normalization (TdN), inspired by the trapdoor function
  in traditional cryptography. To protect intellectual property within deep models,
  the proposed method is able to embed ownership information into normalization layers
  during training. We argue and empirically validate that relevant methods are vulnerable
  to ambiguity attacks, where the forged watermarks can cast ambiguity over the ownership
  verification. The primary trait that distinguishes this work from previous ones,
  is its design of a bidirectional connection between watermarks and deep models.
  Thereby, TdN enables an irreversible ownership verification scheme that is difficult
  for the adversary to compromise. In this way, the proposed TdN can effectively defeat
  ambiguity attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is
  not only superior to previous state-of-the-art methods in robustness, but also has
  better efficiency.'
