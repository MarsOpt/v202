title: 'VectorMapNet: End-to-end Vectorized HD Map Learning'
openreview: 70TiaXJtyF
abstract: Autonomous driving systems require High-Definition (HD) semantic maps to
  navigate around urban roads. Existing solutions approach the semantic mapping problem
  by offline manual annotation, which suffers from serious scalability issues. Recent
  learning-based methods produce dense rasterized segmentation predictions to construct
  maps. However, these predictions do not include instance information of individual
  map elements and require heuristic post-processing to obtain vectorized maps. To
  tackle these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end vectorized HD map learning pipeline,
  termed VectorMapNet. VectorMapNet takes onboard sensor observations and predicts
  a sparse set of polylines in the birdâ€™s-eye view. This pipeline can explicitly model
  the spatial relation between map elements and generate vectorized maps that are
  friendly to downstream autonomous driving tasks. Extensive experiments show that
  VectorMapNet achieve strong map learning performance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2
  dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by 14.2 mAP and 14.6mAP. Qualitatively,
  VectorMapNet is capable of generating comprehensive maps and capturing fine-grained
  details of road geometry. To the best of our knowledge, VectorMapNet is the first
  work designed towards end-to-end vectorized map learning from onboard observations.
