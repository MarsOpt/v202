title: Implicit Neural Spatial Representations for Time-dependent PDEs
openreview: 7BO6rpA6qQ
abstract: 'Implicit Neural Spatial Representation (INSR) has emerged as an effective
  representation of spatially-dependent vector fields. This work explores solving
  time-dependent PDEs with INSR. Classical PDE solvers introduce both temporal and
  spatial discretizations. Common spatial discretizations include meshes and meshless
  point clouds, where each degree-of-freedom corresponds to a location in space. While
  these explicit spatial correspondences are intuitive to model and understand, these
  representations are not necessarily optimal for accuracy, memory usage, or adaptivity.
  Keeping the classical temporal discretization unchanged (e.g., explicit/implicit
  Euler), we explore INSR as an alternative spatial discretization, where spatial
  information is implicitly stored in the neural network weights. The network weights
  then evolve over time via time integration. Our approach does not require any training
  data generated by existing solvers because our approach is the solver itself. We
  validate our approach on various PDEs with examples involving large elastic deformations,
  turbulent fluids, and multi-scale phenomena. While slower to compute than traditional
  representations, our approach exhibits higher accuracy and lower memory consumption.
  Whereas classical solvers can dynamically adapt their spatial representation only
  by resorting to complex remeshing algorithms, our INSR approach is intrinsically
  adaptive. By tapping into the rich literature of classic time integrators, e.g.,
  operator-splitting schemes, our method enables challenging simulations in contact
  mechanics and turbulent flows where previous neural-physics approaches struggle.
