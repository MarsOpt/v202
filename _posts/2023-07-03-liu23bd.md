title: Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection with Diffusion Inpainting
openreview: HiX1ybkFMl
abstract: Unsupervised out-of-distribution detection (OOD) seeks to identify out-of-domain
  data by learning only from unlabeled in-domain data. We present a novel approach
  for this task – Lift, Map, Detect (LMD) – that leverages recent advancement in diffusion
  models. Diffusion models are one type of generative models. At their core, they
  learn an iterative denoising process that gradually maps a noisy image closer to
  their training manifolds. LMD leverages this intuition for OOD detection. Specifically,
  LMD lifts an image off its original manifold by corrupting it, and maps it towards
  the in-domain manifold with a diffusion model. For an OOD image, the mapped image
  would have a large distance away from its original manifold, and LMD would identify
  it as OOD accordingly. We show through extensive experiments that LMD achieves competitive
  performance across a broad variety of datasets. Code can be found at https://github.com/zhenzhel/lift_map_detect.
