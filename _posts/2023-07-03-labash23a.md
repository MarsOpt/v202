title: Emergence of Adaptive Circadian Rhythms in Deep Reinforcement Learning
openreview: WoNn3F4dlR
abstract: Adapting to regularities of the environment is critical for biological organisms
  to anticipate events and plan. A prominent example is the circadian rhythm corresponding
  to the internalization by organisms of the $24$-hour period of the Earth’s rotation.
  In this work, we study the emergence of circadian-like rhythms in deep reinforcement
  learning agents. In particular, we deployed agents in an environment with a reliable
  periodic variation while solving a foraging task. We systematically characterize
  the agent’s behavior during learning and demonstrate the emergence of a rhythm that
  is endogenous and entrainable. Interestingly, the internal rhythm adapts to shifts
  in the phase of the environmental signal without any re-training. Furthermore, we
  show via bifurcation and phase response curve analyses how artificial neurons develop
  dynamics to support the internalization of the environmental rhythm. From a dynamical
  systems view, we demonstrate that the adaptation proceeds by the emergence of a
  stable periodic orbit in the neuron dynamics with a phase response that allows an
  optimal phase synchronisation between the agent’s dynamics and the environmental
  rhythm.
