title: Finite-Sample Analysis of Learning High-Dimensional Single ReLU Neuron
openreview: yMs4kwihug
abstract: 'This paper considers the problem of learning single ReLU neuron with squared
  loss (a.k.a., ReLU regression) in the overparameterized regime, where the input
  dimension can exceed the number of samples. We analyze a Perceptron-type algorithm
  called GLM-tron [Kakade et al. 2011], and provide its dimension-free risk upper
  bounds for high-dimensional ReLU regression in both well-specified and misspecified
  settings. Our risk bounds recover several existing results as special cases. Moreover,
  in the well-specified setting, we also provide an instance-wise matching risk lower
  bound for GLM-tron. Our upper and lower risk bounds provide a sharp characterization
  of the high-dimensional ReLU regression problems that can be learned via GLM-tron.
  On the other hand, we provide some negative results for stochastic gradient descent
  (SGD) for ReLU regression with symmetric Bernoulli data: if the model is well-specified,
  the excess risk of SGD is provably no better than that of GLM-tron ignoring constant
  factors, for each problem instance; and in the noiseless case, GLM-tron can achieve
  a small risk while SGD unavoidably suffers from a constant risk in expectation.
  These results together suggest that GLM-tron might be more preferable than SGD for
  high-dimensional ReLU regression.'
