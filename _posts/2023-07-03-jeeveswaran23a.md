title: 'BiRT: Bio-inspired Replay in Vision Transformers for Continual Learning'
openreview: 35ipniftLn
abstract: The ability of deep neural networks to continually learn and adapt to a
  sequence of tasks has remained challenging due to catastrophic forgetting of previously
  learned tasks. Humans, on the other hand, have a remarkable ability to acquire,
  assimilate, and transfer knowledge across tasks throughout their lifetime without
  catastrophic forgetting. The versatility of the brain can be attributed to the rehearsal
  of abstract experiences through a complementary learning system. However, representation
  rehearsal in vision transformers lacks diversity, resulting in overfitting and consequently,
  performance drops significantly compared to raw image rehearsal. Therefore, we propose
  BiRT, a novel representation rehearsal-based continual learning approach using vision
  transformers. Specifically, we introduce controllable noises at various stages of
  the vision transformer and enforce consistency in predictions with respect to an
  exponential moving average of the working model. Our method provides consistent
  performance gain over raw image and vanilla representation rehearsal on several
  challenging CL benchmarks while being memory efficient and robust to natural and
  adversarial corruptions.
