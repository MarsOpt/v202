title: Which Invariance Should We Transfer? A Causal Minimax Learning Approach
openreview: uDeP2vJmho
abstract: 'A major barrier to deploying current machine learning models lies in their
  non-reliability to dataset shifts. To resolve this problem, most existing studies
  attempted to transfer stable information to unseen environments. Particularly, independent
  causal mechanisms-based methods proposed to remove mutable causal mechanisms via
  the do-operator. Compared to previous methods, the obtained stable predictors are
  more effective in identifying stable information. However, a key question remains:
  which subset of this whole stable information should the model transfer, in order
  to achieve optimal generalization ability? To answer this question, we present a
  comprehensive minimax analysis from a causal perspective. Specifically, we first
  provide a graphical condition for the whole stable set to be optimal. When this
  condition fails, we surprisingly find with an example that this whole stable set,
  although can fully exploit stable information, is not the optimal one to transfer.
  To identify the optimal subset under this case, we propose to estimate the worst-case
  risk with a novel optimization scheme over the intervention functions on mutable
  causal mechanisms. We then propose an efficient algorithm to search for the subset
  with minimal worst-case risk, based on a newly defined equivalence relation between
  stable subsets. Compared to the exponential cost of exhaustively searching over
  all subsets, our searching strategy enjoys a polynomial complexity. The effectiveness
  and efficiency of our methods are demonstrated on synthetic data and the diagnosis
  of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.'
