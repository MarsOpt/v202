title: Online Prototype Alignment for Few-shot Policy Transfer
openreview: Ix8o1xIX6y
abstract: Domain adaptation in RL mainly deals with the changes of observation when
  transferring the policy to a new environment. Many traditional approaches of domain
  adaptation in RL manage to learn a mapping function between the source and target
  domain in explicit or implicit ways. However, they typically require access to abundant
  data from the target domain. Besides, they often rely on visual clues to learn the
  mapping function and may fail when the source domain looks quite different from
  the target domain. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel
  framework Online Prototype Alignment (OPA) to learn the mapping function based on
  the functional similarity of elements and is able to achieve few-shot policy transfer
  within only several episodes. The key insight of OPA is to introduce an exploration
  mechanism that can interact with the unseen elements of the target domain in an
  efficient and purposeful manner, and then connect them with the seen elements in
  the source domain according to their functionalities (instead of visual clues).
  Experimental results show that when the target domain looks visually different from
  the source domain, OPA can achieve better transfer performance even with much fewer
  samples from the target domain, outperforming prior methods.
