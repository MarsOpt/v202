title: A Nearly-Optimal Bound for Fast Regression with $\ell_∞$ Guarantee
openreview: cJh37mrFms
abstract: 'Given a matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and a vector $b\in \mathbb{R}^n$,
  we consider the regression problem with $\ell_\infty$ guarantees: finding a vector
  $x’\in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $||x’-x^* ||_\infty \leq \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{d}}\cdot
  ||Ax^*-b||_2\cdot ||A^\dagger||$ with $x^*$ being the optimal solution to the regression
  $||Ax-b||_2$. One popular approach for solving $\ell_2$ regression problem is via
  sketching: picking a structured random matrix $S\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ with
  $m\ll n$ and $SA$ can be quickly computed, solve the “sketched” regression problem
  $x’=\mathrm{argmin} ||SAx-Sb||_2$. In this paper, we show that in order to obtain
  such $\ell_\infty$ guarantee for $\ell_2$ regression, one has to use sketching matrices
  that are <em>dense</em>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first user case
  in which dense sketching matrices are necessary. On the algorithmic side, we prove
  that, there exists a distribution of dense sketching matrices with $m=\epsilon^{-2}d\log^3(n/\delta)$
  such that solving the sketched regression problem gives the $\ell_\infty$ guarantee,
  with probability at least $1-\delta$. Moreover, the matrix $SA$ can be computed
  in time $O(nd\log n)$. Our row count is nearly-optimal up to logarithmic factors,
  and significantly improves the result in [Price, Song and Woodruff, ICALP’17], in
  which $m=\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}d^{1+\gamma})$ for $\gamma\in (0, 1)$ is required.
  Moreover, we develop a novel analytical framework for $\ell_\infty$ guarantee regression
  that utilizes the <em>Oblivious Coordinate-wise Embedding</em> (OCE) property introduced
  in [Song and Yu, ICML’21]. Our analysis is much simpler and more general than that
  of [Price, Song and Woodruff, ICALP’17]. Leveraging this framework, we extend the
  $\ell_\infty$ guarantee regression result to dense sketching matrices for computing
  fast tensor product of vectors.'
