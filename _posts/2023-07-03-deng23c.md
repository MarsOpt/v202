title: Multi-channel Autobidding with Budget and ROI Constraints
openreview: UdiUd99I81
abstract: 'In digital online advertising, advertisers procure ad impressions simultaneously
  on multiple platforms, or so-called channels, such as Google Ads, Meta Ads Manager,
  etc., each of which consists of numerous ad auctions. We study how an advertiser
  maximizes total conversion (e.g. ad clicks) while satisfying aggregate return-on-investment
  (ROI) and budget constraints across all channels. In practice, an advertiser does
  not have control over, and thus cannot globally optimize, which individual ad auctions
  she participates in for each channel, and instead authorizes a channel to procure
  impressions on her behalf: the advertiser can only utilize two levers on each channel,
  namely setting a per-channel budget and per-channel target ROI. In this work, we
  first analyze the effectiveness of each of these levers for solving the advertiserâ€™s
  global multi-channel problem. We show that when an advertiser only optimizes over
  per-channel ROIs, her total conversion can be arbitrarily worse than what she could
  have obtained in the global problem. Further, we show that the advertiser can achieve
  the global optimal conversion when she only optimizes over per-channel budgets.
  In light of this finding, under a bandit feedback setting that mimics real-world
  scenarios where advertisers have limited information on ad auctions in each channels
  and how channels procure ads, we present an efficient learning algorithm that produces
  per-channel budgets whose resulting conversion approximates that of the global optimal
  problem.'
