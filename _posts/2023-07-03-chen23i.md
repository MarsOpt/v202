title: Subequivariant Graph Reinforcement Learning in 3D Environments
openreview: 4YYgtY1APK
abstract: Learning a shared policy that guides the locomotion of different agents
  is of core interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which leads to the study of
  morphology-agnostic RL. However, existing benchmarks are highly restrictive in the
  choice of starting point and target point, constraining the movement of the agents
  within 2D space. In this work, we propose a novel setup for morphology-agnostic
  RL, dubbed Subequivariant Graph RL in 3D environments (3D-SGRL). Specifically, we
  first introduce a new set of more practical yet challenging benchmarks in 3D space
  that allows the agent to have full Degree-of-Freedoms to explore in arbitrary directions
  starting from arbitrary configurations. Moreover, to optimize the policy over the
  enlarged state-action space, we propose to inject geometric symmetry, i.e., subequivariance,
  into the modeling of the policy and Q-function such that the policy can generalize
  to all directions, improving exploration efficiency. This goal is achieved by a
  novel SubEquivariant Transformer (SET) that permits expressive message exchange.
  Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on the proposed benchmarks, where our method
  consistently and significantly outperforms existing approaches on single-task, multi-task,
  and zero-shot generalization scenarios. Extensive ablations are also conducted to
  verify our design.
