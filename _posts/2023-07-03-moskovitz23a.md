title: 'ReLOAD: Reinforcement Learning with Optimistic Ascent-Descent for Last-Iterate
  Convergence in Constrained MDPs'
openreview: 8Hwfncc2Km
abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to real-world
  problems with increasing success. Such applications often require to put constraints
  on the agent’s behavior. Existing algorithms for constrained RL (CRL) rely on gradient
  descent-ascent, but this approach comes with a caveat. While these algorithms are
  guaranteed to converge on average, they do not guarantee last-iterate convergence,
  i.e., the current policy of the agent may never converge to the optimal solution.
  In practice, it is often observed that the policy alternates between satisfying
  the constraints and maximizing the reward, rarely accomplishing both objectives
  simultaneously. Here, we address this problem by introducing Reinforcement Learning
  with Optimistic Ascent-Descent (ReLOAD), a principled CRL method with guaranteed
  last-iterate convergence. We demonstrate its empirical effectiveness on a wide variety
  of CRL problems including discrete MDPs and continuous control. In the process we
  establish a benchmark of challenging CRL problems.
