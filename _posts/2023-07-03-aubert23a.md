title: On the convergence of the MLE as an estimator of the learning rate in the Exp3
  algorithm
openreview: YvrxWGWg9E
abstract: When fitting the learning data of an individual to algorithm-like learning
  models, the observations are so dependent and non-stationary that one may wonder
  what the classical Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) could do, even if it is the
  usual tool applied to experimental cognition. Our objective in this work is to show
  that the estimation of the learning rate cannot be efficient if the learning rate
  is constant in the classical Exp3 (Exponential weights for Exploration and Exploitation)
  algorithm. Secondly, we show that if the learning rate decreases polynomially with
  the sample size, then the prediction error and in some cases the estimation error
  of the MLE satisfy bounds in probability that decrease at a polynomial rate.
