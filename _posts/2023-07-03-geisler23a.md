title: Transformers Meet Directed Graphs
openreview: a7PVyayyfp
abstract: 'Transformers were originally proposed as a sequence-to-sequence model for
  text but have become vital for a wide range of modalities, including images, audio,
  video, and undirected graphs. However, transformers for directed graphs are a surprisingly
  underexplored topic, despite their applicability to ubiquitous domains, including
  source code and logic circuits. In this work, we propose two direction- and structure-aware
  positional encodings for directed graphs: (1) the eigenvectors of the Magnetic Laplacian
  — a direction-aware generalization of the combinatorial Laplacian; (2) directional
  random walk encodings. Empirically, we show that the extra directionality information
  is useful in various downstream tasks, including correctness testing of sorting
  networks and source code understanding. Together with a data-flow-centric graph
  construction, our model outperforms the prior state of the art on the Open Graph
  Benchmark Code2 relatively by 14.7%.'
