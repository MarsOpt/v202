title: Approximately Optimal Core Shapes for Tensor Decompositions
openreview: XjTcC4EA4P
abstract: This work studies the combinatorial optimization problem of finding an optimal
  core tensor shape, also called multilinear rank, for a size-constrained Tucker decomposition.
  We give an algorithm with provable approximation guarantees for its reconstruction
  error via connections to higher-order singular values. Specifically, we introduce
  a novel Tucker packing problem, which we prove is NP-hard, and give a polynomial-time
  approximation scheme based on a reduction to the 2-dimensional knapsack problem
  with a matroid constraint. We also generalize our techniques to tree tensor network
  decompositions. We implement our algorithm using an integer programming solver,
  and show that its solution quality is competitive with (and sometimes better than)
  the greedy algorithm that uses the true Tucker decomposition loss at each step,
  while also running up to 1000x faster.
