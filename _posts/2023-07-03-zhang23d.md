title: Matrix Estimation for Individual Fairness
openreview: hvEwJ3xYxx
abstract: In recent years, multiple notions of algorithmic fairness have arisen. One
  such notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who are
  similar receive similar treatment. In parallel, matrix estimation (ME) has emerged
  as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In this work,
  we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using ME can improve
  an algorithmâ€™s IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically, we show that using
  a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding (SVT) to pre-process the
  data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate conditions. We then show that,
  under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing also yields estimates that are consistent
  and approximately minimax optimal. As such, the ME pre-processing step does not,
  under the stated conditions, increase the prediction error of the base algorithm,
  i.e., does not impose a fairness-performance trade-off. We verify these results
  on synthetic and real data.
