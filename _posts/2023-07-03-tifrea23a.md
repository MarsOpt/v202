title: 'Margin-based sampling in high dimensions: When being active is less efficient
  than staying passive'
openreview: evgruLDFtA
abstract: 'It is widely believed that given the same labeling budget, active learning
  (AL) algorithms like margin-based active learning achieve better predictive performance
  than passive learning (PL), albeit at a higher computational cost. Recent empirical
  evidence suggests that this added cost might be in vain, as margin-based AL can
  sometimes perform even worse than PL. While existing works offer different explanations
  in the low-dimensional regime, this paper shows that the underlying mechanism is
  entirely different in high dimensions: we prove for logistic regression that PL
  outperforms margin-based AL even for noiseless data and when using the Bayes optimal
  decision boundary for sampling. Insights from our proof indicate that this high-dimensional
  phenomenon is exacerbated when the separation between the classes is small. We corroborate
  this intuition with experiments on 20 high-dimensional datasets spanning a diverse
  range of applications, from finance and histology to chemistry and computer vision.'
