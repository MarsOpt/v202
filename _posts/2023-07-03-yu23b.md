title: Delving into Noisy Label Detection with Clean Data
openreview: qAW0AD6qYA
abstract: A critical element of learning with noisy labels is noisy label detection.
  Notably, numerous previous works assume that no source of labels can be clean in
  a noisy label detection context. In this work, we relax this assumption and assume
  that a small subset of the training data is clean, which enables substantial noisy
  label detection performance gains. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that
  leverages clean data by framing the problem of noisy label detection with clean
  data as a multiple hypothesis testing problem. Moreover, we propose BHN, a simple
  yet effective approach for noisy label detection that integrates the Benjamini-Hochberg
  (BH) procedure into deep neural networks. BHN achieves $\textit{state-of-the-art}$
  performance and outperforms baselines by $\textbf{28.48}$% in terms of false discovery
  rate (FDR) and by $\textbf{18.99}$% in terms of F1 on CIFAR-10. Extensive ablation
  studies further demonstrate the superiority of BHN. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChenglinYu/BHN.
