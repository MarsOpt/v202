title: Training Deep Surrogate Models with Large Scale Online Learning
openreview: WT70GgYdLI
abstract: The spatiotemporal resolution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) plays
  important roles in the mathematical description of the worldâ€™s physical phenomena.
  In general, scientists and engineers solve PDEs numerically by the use of computationally
  demanding solvers. Recently, deep learning algorithms have emerged as a viable alternative
  for obtaining fast solutions for PDEs. Models are usually trained on synthetic data
  generated by solvers, stored on disk and read back for training. This paper advocates
  that relying on a traditional static dataset to train these models does not allow
  the full benefit of the solver to be used as a data generator. It proposes an open
  source online training framework for deep surrogate models. The framework implements
  several levels of parallelism focused on simultaneously generating numerical simulations
  and training deep neural networks. This approach suppresses the I/O and storage
  bottleneck associated with disk-loaded datasets, and opens the way to training on
  significantly larger datasets. Experiments compare the offline and online training
  of four surrogate models, including state-of-the-art architectures. Results indicate
  that exposing deep surrogate models to more dataset diversity, up to hundreds of
  GB, can increase model generalization capabilities. Fully connected neural networks,
  Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and Message Passing PDE Solver prediction accuracy
  is improved by 68%, 16% and 7%, respectively.
