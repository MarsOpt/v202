title: 'MetaDiffuser: Diffusion Model as Conditional Planner for Offline Meta-RL'
openreview: IKCk6th595
abstract: Recently, diffusion model shines as a promising backbone for the sequence
  modeling paradigm in offline reinforcement learning(RL). However, these works mostly
  lack the generalization ability across tasks with reward or dynamics change. To
  tackle this challenge, in this paper we propose a task-oriented conditioned diffusion
  planner for offline meta-RL(MetaDiffuser), which considers the generalization problem
  as conditional trajectory generation task with contextual representation. The key
  is to learn a context conditioned diffusion model which can generate task-oriented
  trajectories for planning across diverse tasks. To enhance the dynamics consistency
  of the generated trajectories while encouraging trajectories to achieve high returns,
  we further design a dual-guided module in the sampling process of the diffusion
  model. The proposed framework enjoys the robustness to the quality of collected
  warm-start data from the testing task and the flexibility to incorporate with different
  task representation method. The experiment results on MuJoCo benchmarks show that
  MetaDiffuser outperforms other strong offline meta-RL baselines, demonstrating the
  outstanding conditional generation ability of diffusion architecture.
