title: Learning Prescriptive ReLU Networks
openreview: x9VwD7x64f
abstract: We study the problem of learning optimal policy from a set of discrete treatment
  options using observational data. We propose a piecewise linear neural network model
  that can balance strong prescriptive performance and interpretability, which we
  refer to as the prescriptive ReLU network, or P-ReLU. We show analytically that
  this model (i) partitions the input space into disjoint polyhedra, where all instances
  that belong to the same partition receive the same treatment, and (ii) can be converted
  into an equivalent prescriptive tree with hyperplane splits for interpretability.
  We demonstrate the flexibility of the P-ReLU network as constraints can be easily
  incorporated with minor modifications to the architecture. Through experiments,
  we validate the superior prescriptive accuracy of P-ReLU against competing benchmarks.
  Lastly, we present examples of prescriptive trees extracted from trained P-ReLUs
  using a real-world dataset, for both the unconstrained and constrained scenarios.
