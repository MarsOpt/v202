title: Spatial Implicit Neural Representations for Global-Scale Species Mapping
openreview: C6IDiP5Or9
abstract: Estimating the geographical range of a species from sparse observations
  is a challenging and important geospatial prediction problem. Given a set of locations
  where a species has been observed, the goal is to build a model to predict whether
  the species is present or absent at any location. This problem has a long history
  in ecology, but traditional methods struggle to take advantage of emerging large-scale
  crowdsourced datasets which can include tens of millions of records for hundreds
  of thousands of species. In this work, we use Spatial Implicit Neural Representations
  (SINRs) to jointly estimate the geographical range of 47k species simultaneously.
  We find that our approach scales gracefully, making increasingly better predictions
  as we increase the number of species and the amount of data per species when training.
  To make this problem accessible to machine learning researchers, we provide four
  new benchmarks that measure different aspects of species range estimation and spatial
  representation learning. Using these benchmarks, we demonstrate that noisy and biased
  crowdsourced data can be combined with implicit neural representations to approximate
  expert-developed range maps for many species.
