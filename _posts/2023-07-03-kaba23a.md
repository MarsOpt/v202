title: Equivariance with Learned Canonicalization Functions
openreview: Jng8ejqTZi
abstract: Symmetry-based neural networks often constrain the architecture in order
  to achieve invariance or equivariance to a group of transformations. In this paper,
  we propose an alternative that avoids this architectural constraint by learning
  to produce canonical representations of the data. These canonicalization functions
  can readily be plugged into non-equivariant backbone architectures. We offer explicit
  ways to implement them for some groups of interest. We show that this approach enjoys
  universality while providing interpretable insights. Our main hypothesis, supported
  by our empirical results, is that learning a small neural network to perform canonicalization
  is better than using predefined heuristics. Our experiments show that learning the
  canonicalization function is competitive with existing techniques for learning equivariant
  functions across many tasks, including image classification, $N$-body dynamics prediction,
  point cloud classification and part segmentation, while being faster across the
  board.
