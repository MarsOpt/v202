title: Estimating Causal Effects using a Multi-task Deep Ensemble
openreview: 0CVQd9nPUn
abstract: A number of methods have been proposed for causal effect estimation, yet
  few have demonstrated efficacy in handling data with complex structures, such as
  images. To fill this gap, we propose Causal Multi-task Deep Ensemble (CMDE), a novel
  framework that learns both shared and group-specific information from the study
  population. We provide proofs demonstrating equivalency of CDME to a multi-task
  Gaussian process (GP) with a coregionalization kernel a priori. Compared to multi-task
  GP, CMDE efficiently handles high-dimensional and multi-modal covariates and provides
  pointwise uncertainty estimates of causal effects. We evaluate our method across
  various types of datasets and tasks and find that CMDE outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods on a majority of these tasks.
