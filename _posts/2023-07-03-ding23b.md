title: 'DSGD-CECA: Decentralized SGD with Communication-Optimal Exact Consensus Algorithm'
openreview: nVO6YTca8O
abstract: Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an emerging neural network
  training approach that enables multiple agents to train a model collaboratively
  and simultaneously. Rather than using a central parameter server to collect gradients
  from all the agents, each agent keeps a copy of the model parameters and communicates
  with a small number of other agents to exchange model updates. Their communication,
  governed by the communication topology and gossip weight matrices, facilitates the
  exchange of model updates. The state-of-the-art approach uses the dynamic one-peer
  exponential-2 topology, achieving faster training times and improved scalability
  than the ring, grid, torus, and hypercube topologies. However, this approach requires
  a power-of-2 number of agents, which is impractical at scale. In this paper, we
  remove this restriction and propose Decentralized SGD with Communication-optimal
  Exact Consensus Algorithm (DSGD-CECA), which works for any number of agents while
  still achieving state-of-the-art properties. In particular, DSGD-CECA incurs a unit
  per-iteration communication overhead and an $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ transient iteration
  complexity. Our proof is based on newly discovered properties of gossip weight matrices
  and a novel approach to combine them with DSGDâ€™s convergence analysis. Numerical
  experiments show the efficiency of DSGD-CECA.
