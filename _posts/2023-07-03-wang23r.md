title: 'Slot-VAE: Object-Centric Scene Generation with Slot Attention'
openreview: ABzDOXlxf0
abstract: Slot attention has shown remarkable object-centric representation learning
  performance in computer vision tasks without requiring any supervision. Despite
  its object-centric binding ability brought by compositional modelling, as a deterministic
  module, slot attention lacks the ability to generate novel scenes. In this paper,
  we propose the Slot-VAE, a generative model that integrates slot attention with
  the hierarchical VAE framework for object-centric structured scene generation. For
  each image, the model simultaneously infers a global scene representation to capture
  high-level scene structure and object-centric slot representations to embed individual
  object components. During generation, slot representations are generated from the
  global scene representation to ensure coherent scene structures. Our extensive evaluation
  of the scene generation ability indicates that Slot-VAE outperforms slot representation-based
  generative baselines in terms of sample quality and scene structure accuracy.
