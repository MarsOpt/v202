title: 'Analyzing Convergence in Quantum Neural Networks: Deviations from Neural Tangent
  Kernels'
openreview: 4XjFCzngFq
abstract: 'A quantum neural network (QNN) is a parameterized mapping efficiently implementable
  on near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. It can be used for
  supervised learning when combined with classical gradient-based optimizers. Despite
  the existing empirical and theoretical investigations, the convergence of QNN training
  is not fully understood. Inspired by the success of the neural tangent kernels (NTKs)
  in probing into the dynamics of classical neural networks, a recent line of works
  proposes to study over-parameterized QNNs by examining a quantum version of tangent
  kernels. In this work, we study the dynamics of QNNs and show that contrary to popular
  belief it is qualitatively different from that of any kernel regression: due to
  the unitarity of quantum operations, there is a non-negligible deviation from the
  tangent kernel regression derived at the random initialization. As a result of the
  deviation, we prove the at-most sublinear convergence for QNNs with Pauli measurements,
  which is beyond the explanatory power of any kernel regression dynamics. We then
  present the actual dynamics of QNNs in the limit of over-parameterization. The new
  dynamics capture the change of convergence rate during training and implies that
  the range of measurements is crucial to the fast QNN convergence.'
