title: 'K-SHAP: Policy Clustering Algorithm for Anonymous Multi-Agent State-Action
  Pairs'
openreview: 1s3P1SjAsF
abstract: 'Learning agent behaviors from observational data has shown to improve our
  understanding of their decision-making processes, advancing our ability to explain
  their interactions with the environment and other agents. While multiple learning
  techniques have been proposed in the literature, there is one particular setting
  that has not been explored yet: multi agent systems where agent identities remain
  anonymous. For instance, in financial markets labeled data that identifies market
  participant strategies is typically proprietary, and only the anonymous state-action
  pairs that result from the interaction of multiple market participants are publicly
  available. As a result, sequences of agent actions are not observable, restricting
  the applicability of existing work. In this paper, we propose a Policy Clustering
  algorithm, called K-SHAP, that learns to group anonymous state-action pairs according
  to the agent policies. We frame the problem as an Imitation Learning (IL) task,
  and we learn a world-policy able to mimic all the agent behaviors upon different
  environmental states. We leverage the world-policy to explain each anonymous observation
  through an additive feature attribution method called SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
  Finally, by clustering the explanations we show that we are able to identify different
  agent policies and group observations accordingly. We evaluate our approach on simulated
  synthetic market data and a real-world financial dataset. We show that our proposal
  significantly and consistently outperforms the existing methods, identifying different
  agent strategies.'
