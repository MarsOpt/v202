title: 'Nugget: Neural Agglomerative Embeddings of Text'
openreview: LhFE049fh5
abstract: Embedding text sequences is a widespread requirement in modern language
  understanding. Existing approaches focus largely on constant-size representations.
  This is problematic, as the amount of information contained in text often varies
  with the length of the input. We propose a solution called Nugget, which encodes
  language into a representation based on a dynamically selected subset of input tokens.
  These nuggets are learned through tasks like autoencoding and machine translation,
  and intuitively segment language into meaningful units. We demonstrate Nugget outperforms
  related approaches in tasks involving semantic comparison. Finally, we illustrate
  these compact units allow for expanding the contextual window of a language model
  (LM), suggesting new future LMs that can condition on significantly larger amounts
  of content.
