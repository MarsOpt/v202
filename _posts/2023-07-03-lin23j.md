title: Fast Online Value-Maximizing Prediction Sets with Conformal Cost Control
openreview: 0VeyziIEcJ
abstract: Many real-world multi-label prediction problems involve set-valued predictions
  that must satisfy specific requirements dictated by downstream usage. We focus on
  a typical scenario where such requirements, separately encoding <em>value</em> and
  <em>cost</em>, compete with each other. For instance, a hospital might expect a
  smart diagnosis system to capture as many severe, often co-morbid, diseases as possible
  (the value), while maintaining strict control over incorrect predictions (the cost).
  We present a general pipeline, dubbed as FavMac, to maximize the value while controlling
  the cost in such scenarios. FavMac can be combined with almost any multi-label classifier,
  affording distribution-free theoretical guarantees on cost control. Moreover, unlike
  prior works, FavMac can handle real-world large-scale applications via a carefully
  designed online update mechanism, which is of independent interest. Our methodological
  and theoretical contributions are supported by experiments on several healthcare
  tasks and synthetic datasets - FavMac furnishes higher value compared with several
  variants and baselines while maintaining strict cost control.
