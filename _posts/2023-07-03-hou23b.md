title: 'PromptBoosting: Black-Box Text Classification with Ten Forward Passes'
openreview: pL3oJd7lDV
abstract: We describe PromptBoosting, a query-efficient procedure for building a text
  classifier from a neural language model (LM) without access to the LM’s parameters,
  gradients, or hidden representations. This form of "black-box" classifier training
  has become increasingly important as the cost of training and inference in large-scale
  LMs has grown. But existing black-box LM classifier learning approaches are themselves
  computationally inefficient, typically specializing LMs to the target task by searching
  in a large space of (discrete or continuous) prompts using zeroth-order optimization
  methods. Instead of directly optimizing in prompt space, PromptBoosting obtains
  a small pool of prompts via a gradient-free approach and then constructs a large
  pool of weak learners by pairing these prompts with different elements of the LM’s
  output distribution. These weak learners are then ensembled using the AdaBoost algorithm.
  The entire learning process requires only a small number of forward passes and no
  backward pass. Experiments show that PromptBoosting achieves state-of-the-art performance
  in multiple black-box few-shot classification tasks, and matches or outperforms
  full fine-tuning in both few-shot and standard learning paradigms, while training
  10x faster than existing black-box methods.
