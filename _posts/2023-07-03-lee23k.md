title: H-Likelihood Approach to Deep Neural Networks with Temporal-Spatial Random
  Effects for High-Cardinality Categorical Features
openreview: MtopPVk3Ll
abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are one of the most powerful tools for prediction,
  but many of them implicitly assume that the data are statistically independent.
  However, in the real world, it is common for large-scale data to be clustered with
  temporal-spatial correlation structures. Variational approaches and integrated likelihood
  approaches have been proposed to obtain approximate maximum likelihood estimators
  (MLEs) for correlated data. However, due to the large size of data, they cannot
  provide exact MLEs. In this study, we propose a new hierarchical likelihood approach
  to DNNs with correlated random effects for clustered data. By jointly optimizing
  the the negative h-likelihood loss, we can provide exact MLEs for both mean and
  dispersion parameters, as well as the best linear unbiased predictors for the random
  effects. Moreover, the hierarchical likelihood allows a computable procedure for
  restricted maximum likelihood estimators of dispersion parameters. The proposed
  two-step algorithm enables online learning for the neural networks, whereas the
  integrated likelihood cannot decompose like a widely-used loss function in DNNs.
  The proposed h-likelihood approach offers several advantages, which we demonstrate
  through numerical studies and real data analyses.
