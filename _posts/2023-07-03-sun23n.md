title: 'SDDM: Score-Decomposed Diffusion Models on Manifolds for Unpaired Image-to-Image
  Translation'
openreview: J4w91xRPBY
abstract: Recent score-based diffusion models (SBDMs) show promising results in unpaired
  image-to-image translation (I2I). However, existing methods, either energy-based
  or statistically-based, provide no explicit form of the interfered intermediate
  generative distributions. This work presents a new score-decomposed diffusion model
  (SDDM) on manifolds to explicitly optimize the tangled distributions during image
  generation. SDDM derives manifolds to make the distributions of adjacent time steps
  separable and decompose the score function or energy guidance into an image "denoising"
  part and a content "refinement" part. To refine the image in the same noise level,
  we equalize the refinement parts of the score function and energy guidance, which
  permits multi-objective optimization on the manifold. We also leverage the block
  adaptive instance normalization module to construct manifolds with lower dimensions
  but still concentrated with the perturbed reference image. SDDM outperforms existing
  SBDM-based methods with much fewer diffusion steps on several I2I benchmarks.
