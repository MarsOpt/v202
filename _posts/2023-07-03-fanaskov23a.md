title: General Covariance Data Augmentation for Neural PDE Solvers
openreview: glID3Vsmc0
abstract: The growing body of research shows how to replace classical partial differential
  equation (PDE) integrators with neural networks. The popular strategy is to generate
  the input-output pairs with a PDE solver, train the neural network in the regression
  setting, and use the trained model as a cheap surrogate for the solver. The bottleneck
  in this scheme is the number of expensive queries of a PDE solver needed to generate
  the dataset. To alleviate the problem, we propose a computationally cheap augmentation
  strategy based on general covariance and simple random coordinate transformations.
  Our approach relies on the fact that physical laws are independent of the coordinate
  choice, so the change in the coordinate system preserves the type of a parametric
  PDE and only changes PDEâ€™s data (e.g., initial conditions, diffusion coefficient).
  For tried neural networks and partial differential equations, proposed augmentation
  improves test error by 23% on average. The worst observed result is a 17% increase
  in test error for multilayer perceptron, and the best case is a 80% decrease for
  dilated residual network.
