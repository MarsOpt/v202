title: 'Alternating Local Enumeration (TnALE): Solving Tensor Network Structure Search
  with Fewer Evaluations'
openreview: bM6k20itV9
abstract: Tensor network (TN) is a powerful framework in machine learning, but selecting
  a good TN model, known as TN structure search (TN-SS), is a challenging and computationally
  intensive task. The recent approach TNLS (Li et al., 2022) showed promising results
  for this task. However, its computational efficiency is still unaffordable, requiring
  too many evaluations of the objective function. We propose TnALE, a surprisingly
  simple algorithm that updates each structure-related variable alternately by local
  enumeration, greatly reducing the number of evaluations compared to TNLS. We theoretically
  investigate the descent steps for TNLS and TnALE, proving that both the algorithms
  can achieve linear convergence up to a constant if a sufficient reduction of the
  objective is reached in each neighborhood. We further compare the evaluation efficiency
  of TNLS and TnALE, revealing that $\Omega(2^K)$ evaluations are typically required
  in TNLS for reaching the objective reduction, while ideally $O(KR)$ evaluations
  are sufficient in TnALE, where $K$ denotes the dimension of search space and $R$
  reflects the “low-rankness” of the neighborhood. Experimental results verify that
  TnALE can find practically good TN structures with vastly fewer evaluations than
  the state-of-the-art algorithms.
