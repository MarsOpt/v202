title: Constrained Efficient Global Optimization of Expensive Black-box Functions
openreview: lK1B1yl289
abstract: We study the problem of constrained efficient global optimization, where
  both the objective and constraints are expensive black-box functions that can be
  learned with Gaussian processes. We propose CONFIG (CONstrained efFIcient Global
  Optimization), a simple and effective algorithm to solve it. Under certain regularity
  assumptions, we show that our algorithm enjoys the same cumulative regret bound
  as that in the unconstrained case and similar cumulative constraint violation upper
  bounds. For commonly used Matern and Squared Exponential kernels, our bounds are
  sublinear and allow us to derive a convergence rate to the optimal solution of the
  original constrained problem. In addition, our method naturally provides a scheme
  to declare infeasibility when the original black-box optimization problem is infeasible.
  Numerical experiments on sampled instances from the Gaussian process, artificial
  numerical problems, and a black-box building controller tuning problem all demonstrate
  the competitive performance of our algorithm. Compared to the other state-of-the-art
  methods, our algorithm significantly improves the theoretical guarantees while achieving
  competitive empirical performance.
