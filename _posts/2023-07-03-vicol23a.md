title: Low-Variance Gradient Estimation in Unrolled Computation Graphs with ES-Single
openreview: K0InBsKODr
abstract: 'We propose an evolution strategies-based algorithm for estimating gradients
  in unrolled computation graphs, called ES-Single. Similarly to the recently-proposed
  Persistent Evolution Strategies (PES), ES-Single is unbiased, and overcomes chaos
  arising from recursive function applications by smoothing the meta-loss landscape.
  ES-Single samples a single perturbation per particle, that is kept fixed over the
  course of an inner problem (e.g., perturbations are not re-sampled for each partial
  unroll). Compared to PES, ES-Single is simpler to implement and has lower variance:
  the variance of ES-Single is constant with respect to the number of truncated unrolls,
  removing a key barrier in applying ES to long inner problems using short truncations.
  We show that ES-Single is unbiased for quadratic inner problems, and demonstrate
  empirically that its variance can be substantially lower than that of PES. ES-Single
  consistently outperforms PES on a variety of tasks, including a synthetic benchmark
  task, hyperparameter optimization, training recurrent neural networks, and training
  learned optimizers.'
