title: Conformal Prediction for Federated Uncertainty Quantification Under Label Shift
openreview: ytpEqHYSEy
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning framework where many clients
  collaboratively train models while keeping the training data decentralized. Despite
  recent advances in FL, the uncertainty quantification topic (UQ) remains partially
  addressed. Among UQ methods, conformal prediction (CP) approaches provides distribution-free
  guarantees under minimal assumptions. We develop a new federated conformal prediction
  method based on quantile regression and take into account privacy constraints. This
  method takes advantage of importance weighting to effectively address the label
  shift between agents and provides theoretical guarantees for both valid coverage
  of the prediction sets and differential privacy. Extensive experimental studies
  demonstrate that this method outperforms current competitors.
