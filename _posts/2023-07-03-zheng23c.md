title: Improved Techniques for Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Diffusion ODEs
openreview: jVR2fF8x8x
abstract: Diffusion models have exhibited excellent performance in various domains.
  The probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) of diffusion models (i.e.,
  diffusion ODEs) is a particular case of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs), which
  enables deterministic inference and exact likelihood evaluation. However, the likelihood
  estimation results by diffusion ODEs are still far from those of the state-of-the-art
  likelihood-based generative models. In this work, we propose several improved techniques
  for maximum likelihood estimation for diffusion ODEs, including both training and
  evaluation perspectives. For training, we propose velocity parameterization and
  explore variance reduction techniques for faster convergence. We also derive an
  error-bounded high-order flow matching objective for finetuning, which improves
  the ODE likelihood and smooths its trajectory. For evaluation, we propose a novel
  training-free truncated-normal dequantization to fill the training-evaluation gap
  commonly existing in diffusion ODEs. Building upon these techniques, we achieve
  state-of-the-art likelihood estimation results on image datasets (2.56 on CIFAR-10,
  3.43/3.69 on ImageNet-32) without variational dequantization or data augmentation.
