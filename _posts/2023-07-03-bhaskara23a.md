title: Bandit Online Linear Optimization with Hints and Queries
openreview: SgeIqUvo4w
abstract: We study variants of the online linear optimization (OLO) problem with bandit
  feedback, where the algorithm has access to external information about the unknown
  cost vector. Our motivation is the recent body of work on using such “hints” towards
  improving regret bounds for OLO problems in the full-information setting. Unlike
  in the full-information OLO setting, with bandit feedback, we first show that one
  cannot improve the standard regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ by using hints,
  even if they are always well-correlated with the cost vector. In contrast, if the
  algorithm is empowered to issue queries and if all the responses are correct, then
  we show $O(\log T)$ regret is achievable. We then show how to make this result more
  robust—when some of the query responses can be adversarial—by using a little feedback
  on the quality of the responses.
