title: Do Machine Learning Models Learn Statistical Rules Inferred from Data?
openreview: CtKKqTZFuV
abstract: Machine learning models can make critical errors that are easily hidden
  within vast amounts of data. Such errors often run counter to rules based on human
  intuition. However, rules based on human knowledge are challenging to scale or to
  even formalize. We thereby seek to infer statistical rules from the data and quantify
  the extent to which a model has learned them. We propose a framework SQRL that integrates
  logic-based methods with statistical inference to derive these rules from a modelâ€™s
  training data without supervision. We further show how to adapt models at test time
  to reduce rule violations and produce more coherent predictions. SQRL generates
  up to 300K rules over datasets from vision, tabular, and language settings. We uncover
  up to 158K violations of those rules by state-of-the-art models for classification,
  object detection, and data imputation. Test-time adaptation reduces these violations
  by up to 68.7% with relative performance improvement up to 32%. SQRL is available
  at https://github.com/DebugML/sqrl.
