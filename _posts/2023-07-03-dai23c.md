title: 'MultiRobustBench: Benchmarking Robustness Against Multiple Attacks'
openreview: xdCQbljiLI
abstract: The bulk of existing research in defending against adversarial examples
  focuses on defending against a single (typically bounded $\ell_p$-norm) attack,
  but for a practical setting, machine learning (ML) models should be robust to a
  wide variety of attacks. In this paper, we present the first unified framework for
  considering multiple attacks against ML models. Our framework is able to model different
  levels of learnerâ€™s knowledge about the test-time adversary, allowing us to model
  robustness against unforeseen attacks and robustness against unions of attacks.
  Using our framework, we present the first leaderboard, MultiRobustBench (https://multirobustbench.github.io),
  for benchmarking multiattack evaluation which captures performance across attack
  types and attack strengths. We evaluate the performance of 16 defended models for
  robustness against a set of 9 different attack types, including $\ell_p$-based threat
  models, spatial transformations, and color changes, at 20 different attack strengths
  (180 attacks total). Additionally, we analyze the state of current defenses against
  multiple attacks. Our analysis shows that while existing defenses have made progress
  in terms of average robustness across the set of attacks used, robustness against
  the worst-case attack is still a big open problem as all existing models perform
  worse than random guessing.
