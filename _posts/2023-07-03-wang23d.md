title: From Hypergraph Energy Functions to Hypergraph Neural Networks
openreview: a032h8Jb9I
abstract: Hypergraphs are a powerful abstraction for representing higher-order interactions
  between entities of interest. To exploit these relationships in making downstream
  predictions, a variety of hypergraph neural network architectures have recently
  been proposed, in large part building upon precursors from the more traditional
  graph neural network (GNN) literature. Somewhat differently, in this paper we begin
  by presenting an expressive family of parameterized, hypergraph-regularized energy
  functions. We then demonstrate how minimizers of these energies effectively serve
  as node embeddings that, when paired with a parameterized classifier, can be trained
  end-to-end via a supervised bilevel optimization process. Later, we draw parallels
  between the implicit architecture of the predictive models emerging from the proposed
  bilevel hypergraph optimization, and existing GNN architectures in common use. Empirically,
  we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on various hypergraph node classification
  benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/yxzwang/PhenomNN.
