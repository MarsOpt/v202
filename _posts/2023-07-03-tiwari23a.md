title: Overcoming Simplicity Bias in Deep Networks using a Feature Sieve
openreview: DnTVBs6zbz
abstract: Simplicity bias is the concerning tendency of deep networks to over-depend
  on simple, weakly predictive features, to the exclusion of stronger, more complex
  features. This causes biased, incorrect model predictions in many real-world applications,
  exacerbated by incomplete training data containing spurious feature-label correlations.
  We propose a direct, interventional method for addressing simplicity bias in DNNs,
  which we call the <em>feature sieve</em>. We aim to automatically identify and suppress
  easily-computable spurious features in lower layers of the network, thereby allowing
  the higher network levels to extract and utilize richer, more meaningful representations.
  We provide concrete evidence of this differential suppression & enhancement of <em>relevant</em>
  features on both controlled datasets and real-world images, and report substantial
  gains on many real-world debiasing benchmarks (11.4% relative gain on Imagenet-A;
  3.2% on BAR, etc). Crucially, we outperform many baselines that incorporate knowledge
  about known spurious or biased attributes, despite our method not using any such
  information. We believe that our <em>feature sieve</em> work opens up exciting new
  research directions in automated adversarial feature extraction & representation
  learning for deep networks.
