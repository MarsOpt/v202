title: 'Langevin Thompson Sampling with Logarithmic Communication: Bandits and Reinforcement
  Learning'
openreview: Z6gczvfpvJ
abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used in sequential decision making due
  to its ease of use and appealing empirical performance. However, many existing analytical
  and empirical results for TS rely on restrictive assumptions on reward distributions,
  such as belonging to conjugate families, which limits their applicability in realistic
  scenarios. Moreover, sequential decision making problems are often carried out in
  a batched manner, either due to the inherent nature of the problem or to serve the
  purpose of reducing communication and computation costs. In this work, we jointly
  study these problems in two popular settings, namely, stochastic multi-armed bandits
  (MABs) and infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL), where TS is used to learn
  the unknown reward distributions and transition dynamics, respectively. We propose
  batched <em>Langevin Thompson Sampling</em> algorithms that leverage MCMC methods
  to sample from approximate posteriors with only logarithmic communication costs
  in terms of batches. Our algorithms are computationally efficient and maintain the
  same order-optimal regret guarantees of $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ for stochastic MABs,
  and $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for RL. We complement our theoretical findings with
  experimental results.
