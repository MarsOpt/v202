title: Active causal structure learning with advice
openreview: u2Ap3vr5zQ
abstract: We introduce the problem of active causal structure learning with advice.
  In the typical well-studied setting, the learning algorithm is given the essential
  graph for the observational distribution and is asked to recover the underlying
  causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) $G^*$ while minimizing the number of interventions
  made. In our setting, we are additionally given side information about $G^*$ as
  advice, e.g. a DAG $G$ purported to be $G^*$. We ask whether the learning algorithm
  can benefit from the advice when it is close to being correct, while still having
  worst-case guarantees even when the advice is arbitrarily bad. Our work is in the
  same space as the growing body of research on <em>algorithms with predictions</em>.
  When the advice is a DAG $G$, we design an adaptive search algorithm to recover
  $G^*$ whose intervention cost is at most $\mathcal{O}(\max\{1, \log \psi\})$ times
  the cost for verifying $G^*$; here, $\psi$ is a distance measure between $G$ and
  $G^*$ that is upper bounded by the number of variables $n$, and is exactly 0 when
  $G=G^*$. Our approximation factor matches the state-of-the-art for the advice-less
  setting.
