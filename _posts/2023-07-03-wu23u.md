title: Learning Functional Distributions with Private Labels
openreview: RZv1wqCOq9
abstract: We study the problem of learning functional distributions in the presence
  of noise. A functional is a map from the space of features to <em>distributions</em>
  over a set of labels, and is often assumed to belong to a known class of hypotheses
  $\mathcal{F}$. Features are generated by a general random process and labels are
  sampled independently from feature-dependent distributions. In privacy sensitive
  applications, labels are passed through a noisy kernel. We consider <em>online learning</em>,
  where at each time step, a predictor attempts to predict the <em>actual</em> (label)
  distribution given only the features and <em>noisy</em> labels in prior steps. The
  performance of the predictor is measured by the expected KL-risk that compares the
  predicted distributions to the underlying truth. We show that the <em>minimax</em>
  expected KL-risk is of order $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T\log|\mathcal{F}|})$ for finite
  hypothesis class $\mathcal{F}$ and <em>any</em> non-trivial noise level. We then
  extend this result to general infinite classes via the concept of <em>stochastic
  sequential covering</em> and provide matching lower and upper bounds for a wide
  range of natural classes.
