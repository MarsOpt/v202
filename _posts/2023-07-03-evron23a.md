title: Continual Learning in Linear Classification on Separable Data
openreview: kkpIrMu3Vf
abstract: We analyze continual learning on a sequence of separable linear classification
  tasks with binary labels. We show theoretically that learning with weak regularization
  reduces to solving a sequential max-margin problem, corresponding to a special case
  of the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) framework. We then develop upper bounds
  on the forgetting and other quantities of interest under various settings with recurring
  tasks, including cyclic and random orderings of tasks. We discuss several practical
  implications to popular training practices like regularization scheduling and weighting.
  We point out several theoretical differences between our continual classification
  setting and a recently studied continual regression setting.
