title: Learning to Initiate and Reason in Event-Driven Cascading Processes
openreview: BJc95DyFNG
abstract: Training agents to control a dynamic environment is a fundamental task in
  AI. In many environments, the dynamics can be summarized by a small set of events
  that capture the semantic behavior of the system. Typically, these events form chains
  or cascades. We often wish to change the system behavior using a single intervention
  that propagates through the cascade. For instance, one may trigger a biochemical
  cascade to switch the state of a cell or, in logistics, reroute a truck to meet
  an unexpected, urgent delivery. We introduce a new supervised learning setup called
  Cascade. An agent observes a system with known dynamics evolving from some initial
  state. The agent is given a structured semantic instruction and needs to make an
  intervention that triggers a cascade of events, such that the system reaches an
  alternative (counterfactual) behavior. We provide a test-bed for this problem, consisting
  of physical objects. We combine semantic tree search with an event-driven forward
  model and devise an algorithm that learns to efficiently search in exponentially
  large semantic trees. We demonstrate that our approach learns to follow instructions
  to intervene in new complex scenes. When provided with an observed cascade of events,
  it can also reason about alternative outcomes.
