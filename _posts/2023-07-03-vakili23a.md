title: Delayed Feedback in Kernel Bandits
openreview: RNRbovY8zV
abstract: Black box optimisation of an unknown function from expensive and noisy evaluations
  is a ubiquitous problem in machine learning, academic research and industrial production.
  An abstraction of the problem can be formulated as a kernel based bandit problem
  (also known as Bayesian optimisation), where a learner aims at optimising a kernelized
  function through sequential noisy observations. The existing work predominantly
  assumes feedback is immediately available; an assumption which fails in many real
  world situations, including recommendation systems, clinical trials and hyperparameter
  tuning. We consider a kernel bandit problem under stochastically delayed feedback,
  and propose an algorithm with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\sqrt{\Gamma_k(T) T}+\mathbb{E}[\tau]\right)$
  regret, where $T$ is the number of time steps, $\Gamma_k(T)$ is the maximum information
  gain of the kernel with $T$ observations, and $\tau$ is the delay random variable.
  This represents a significant improvement over the state of the art regret bound
  of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\Gamma_k(T)\sqrt{ T}+\mathbb{E}[\tau]\Gamma_k(T)\right)$
  reported in (Verma et al., 2022). In particular, for very non-smooth kernels, the
  information gain grows almost linearly in time, trivializing the existing results.
  We also validate our theoretical results with simulations.
