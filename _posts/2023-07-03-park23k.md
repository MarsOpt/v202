title: Accelerated Infeasibility Detection of Constrained Optimization and Fixed-Point
  Iterations
openreview: rsaAjVplzC
abstract: As first-order optimization methods become the method of choice for solving
  large-scale optimization problems, optimization solvers based on first-order algorithms
  are being built. Such general-purpose solvers must robustly detect infeasible or
  misspecified problem instances, but the computational complexity of first-order
  methods for doing so has yet to be formally studied. In this work, we characterize
  the optimal accelerated rate of infeasibility detection. We show that the standard
  fixed-point iteration achieves a $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates,
  respectively, on the normalized iterates and the fixed-point residual converging
  to the infimal displacement vector, while the accelerated fixed-point iteration
  achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/k^2)$ rates. We then provide
  a matching complexity lower bound to establish that $\Theta(1/k^2)$ is indeed the
  optimal accelerated rate.
