title: Efficient and Equivariant Graph Networks for Predicting Quantum Hamiltonian
openreview: pKNQRJZwnV
abstract: We consider the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix, which finds use in
  quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Efficiency and equivariance are
  two important, but conflicting factors. In this work, we propose a SE(3)-equivariant
  network, named QHNet, that achieves efficiency and equivariance. Our key advance
  lies at the innovative design of QHNet architecture, which not only obeys the underlying
  symmetries, but also enables the reduction of number of tensor products by 92%.
  In addition, QHNet prevents the exponential growth of channel dimension when more
  atom types are involved. We perform experiments on MD17 datasets, including four
  molecular systems. Experimental results show that our QHNet can achieve comparable
  performance to the state of the art methods at a significantly faster speed. Besides,
  our QHNet consumes 50% less memory due to its streamlined architecture. Our code
  is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).
