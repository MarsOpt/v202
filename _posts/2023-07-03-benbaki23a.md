title: 'Fast as CHITA: Neural Network Pruning with Combinatorial Optimization'
openreview: RAeN6s9RZV
abstract: 'The sheer size of modern neural networks makes model serving a serious
  computational challenge. A popular class of compression techniques overcomes this
  challenge by pruning or sparsifying the weights of pretrained networks. While useful,
  these techniques often face serious tradeoffs between computational requirements
  and compression quality. In this work, we propose a novel optimization-based pruning
  framework that considers the combined effect of pruning (and updating) multiple
  weights subject to a sparsity constraint. Our approach, CHITA, extends the classical
  Optimal Brain Surgeon framework and results in significant improvements in speed,
  memory, and performance over existing optimization-based approaches for network
  pruning. CHITAâ€™s main workhorse performs combinatorial optimization updates on a
  memory-friendly representation of local quadratic approximation(s) of the loss function.
  On a standard benchmark of pretrained models and datasets, CHITA leads to superior
  sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods. For example, for MLPNet with
  only 2% of the weights retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 63% relative
  to the state of the art. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with fine-tuning
  SGD steps, our method achieves significant accuracy gains over state-of-the-art
  approaches. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/mazumder-lab/CHITA
