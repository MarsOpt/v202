title: Fast $(1+\varepsilon)$-Approximation Algorithms for Binary Matrix Factorization
openreview: Iey50XHA3g
abstract: We introduce efficient $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for the
  binary matrix factorization (BMF) problem, where the inputs are a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times
  d}$, a rank parameter $k>0$, as well as an accuracy parameter $\varepsilon>0$, and
  the goal is to approximate $\mathbf{A}$ as a product of low-rank factors $\mathbf{U}\in\{0,1\}^{n\times
  k}$ and $\mathbf{V}\in\{0,1\}^{k\times d}$. Equivalently, we want to find $\mathbf{U}$
  and $\mathbf{V}$ that minimize the Frobenius loss $\|\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V} - \mathbf{A}\|_F^2$.
  Before this work, the state-of-the-art for this problem was the approximation algorithm
  of Kumar et. al. [ICML 2019], which achieves a $C$-approximation for some constant
  $C\ge 576$. We give the first $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm using running
  time singly exponential in $k$, where $k$ is typically a small integer. Our techniques
  generalize to other common variants of the BMF problem, admitting bicriteria $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
  algorithms for $L_p$ loss functions and the setting where matrix operations are
  performed in $\mathbb{F}_2$. Our approach can be implemented in standard big data
  models, such as the streaming or distributed models.
