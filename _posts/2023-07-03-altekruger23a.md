title: Neural Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Discrepancies with Riesz Kernels
openreview: Ur1Eckuj3V
abstract: Wasserstein gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) functionals
  with non-smooth Riesz kernels show a rich structure as singular measures can become
  absolutely continuous ones and conversely. In this paper we contribute to the understanding
  of such flows. We propose to approximate the backward scheme of Jordan, Kinderlehrer
  and Otto for computing such Wasserstein gradient flows as well as a forward scheme
  for so-called Wasserstein steepest descent flows by neural networks (NNs). Since
  we cannot restrict ourselves to absolutely continuous measures, we have to deal
  with transport plans and velocity plans instead of usual transport maps and velocity
  fields. Indeed, we approximate the disintegration of both plans by generative NNs
  which are learned with respect to appropriate loss functions. In order to evaluate
  the quality of both neural schemes, we benchmark them on the interaction energy.
  Here we provide analytic formulas for Wasserstein schemes starting at a Dirac measure
  and show their convergence as the time step size tends to zero. Finally, we illustrate
  our neural MMD flows by numerical examples.
