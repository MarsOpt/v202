title: Retrosynthetic Planning with Dual Value Networks
openreview: qszhULcjUh
abstract: Retrosynthesis, which aims to find a route to synthesize a target molecule
  from commercially available starting materials, is a critical task in drug discovery
  and materials design. Recently, the combination of ML-based single-step reaction
  predictors with multi-step planners has led to promising results. However, the single-step
  predictors are mostly trained offline to optimize the single-step accuracy, without
  considering complete routes. Here, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to improve
  the single-step predictor, by using a tree-shaped MDP to optimize complete routes.
  Specifically, we propose a novel online training algorithm, called Planning with
  Dual Value Networks (PDVN), which alternates between the planning phase and updating
  phase. In PDVN, we construct two separate value networks to predict the synthesizability
  and cost of molecules, respectively. To maintain the single-step accuracy, we design
  a two-branch network structure for the single-step predictor. On the widely-used
  USPTO dataset, our PDVN algorithm improves the search success rate of existing multi-step
  planners (e.g., increasing the success rate from 85.79% to 98.95% for Retro$^{\ast}$,
  and reducing the number of model calls by half while solving 99.47% molecules for
  RetroGraph). Additionally, PDVN helps find shorter synthesis routes (e.g., reducing
  the average route length from 5.76 to 4.83 for Retro$^{\ast}$, and from 5.63 to
  4.78 for RetroGraph).
