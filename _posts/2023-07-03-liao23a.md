title: Statistical Inference and A/B Testing for First-Price Pacing Equilibria
openreview: gsxuUkWOYT
abstract: We initiate the study of statistical inference and A/B testing for first-price
  pacing equilibria (FPPE). The FPPE model captures the dynamics resulting from large-scale
  first-price auction markets where buyers use pacing-based budget management. Such
  markets arise in the context of internet advertising, where budgets are prevalent.
  We propose a statistical framework for the FPPE model, in which a limit FPPE with
  a continuum of items models the long-run steady-state behavior of the auction platform,
  and an observable FPPE consisting of a finite number of items provides the data
  to estimate primitives of the limit FPPE, such as revenue, Nash social welfare (a
  fair metric of efficiency), and other parameters of interest. We develop central
  limit theorems and asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish
  the asymptotic local minimax optimality of our estimators. We then show that the
  theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms.
  Numerical simulations verify our central limit theorems, and empirical coverage
  rates for our confidence intervals agree with our theory.
