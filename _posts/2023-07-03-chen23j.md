title: 'GuardHFL: Privacy Guardian for Heterogeneous Federated Learning'
openreview: iASUTBGw07
abstract: Heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) enables clients with different computation
  and communication capabilities to collaboratively train their own customized models
  via a query-response paradigm on auxiliary datasets. However, such a paradigm raises
  serious privacy concerns due to the leakage of highly sensitive query samples and
  response predictions. We put forth GuardHFL, the first-of-its-kind efficient and
  privacy-preserving HFL framework. GuardHFL is equipped with a novel HFL-friendly
  secure querying scheme built on lightweight secret sharing and symmetric-key techniques.
  The core of GuardHFL is two customized multiplication and comparison protocols,
  which substantially boost the execution efficiency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
  that GuardHFL significantly outperforms the alternative instantiations based on
  existing state-of-the-art techniques in both runtime and communication cost.
