title: Neural Inverse Operators for Solving PDE Inverse Problems
openreview: S4fEjmWg4X
abstract: A large class of inverse problems for PDEs are only well-defined as mappings
  from operators to functions. Existing operator learning frameworks map functions
  to functions and need to be modified to learn inverse maps from data. We propose
  a novel architecture termed Neural Inverse Operators (NIOs) to solve these PDE inverse
  problems. Motivated by the underlying mathematical structure, NIO is based on a
  suitable composition of DeepONets and FNOs to approximate mappings from operators
  to functions. A variety of experiments are presented to demonstrate that NIOs significantly
  outperform baselines and solve PDE inverse problems robustly, accurately and are
  several orders of magnitude faster than existing direct and PDE-constrained optimization
  methods.
