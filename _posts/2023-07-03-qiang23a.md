title: 'Coarse-to-Fine: a Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Molecule Generation in
  3D'
openreview: 7haEvhb25X
abstract: Generating desirable molecular structures in 3D is a fundamental problem
  for drug discovery. Despite the considerable progress we have achieved, existing
  methods usually generate molecules in atom resolution and ignore intrinsic local
  structures such as rings, which leads to poor quality in generated structures, especially
  when generating large molecules. Fragment-based molecule generation is a promising
  strategy, however, it is nontrivial to be adapted for 3D non-autoregressive generations
  because of the combinational optimization problems. In this paper, we utilize a
  coarse-to-fine strategy to tackle this problem, in which a Hierarchical Diffusion-based
  model (i.e. HierDiff) is proposed to preserve the validity of local segments without
  relying on autoregressive modeling. Specifically, HierDiff first generates coarse-grained
  molecule geometries via an equivariant diffusion process, where each coarse-grained
  node reflects a fragment in a molecule. Then the coarse-grained nodes are decoded
  into fine-grained fragments by a message-passing process and a newly designed iterative
  refined sampling module. Lastly, the fine-grained fragments are then assembled to
  derive a complete atomic molecular structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  that HierDiff consistently improves the quality of molecule generation over existing
  methods.
