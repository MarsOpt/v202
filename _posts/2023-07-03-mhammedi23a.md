title: 'Representation Learning with Multi-Step Inverse Kinematics: An Efficient and
  Optimal Approach to Rich-Observation RL'
openreview: rVtdWHPFxX
abstract: We study the design of sample-efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning
  in the presence of rich, high-dimensional observations, formalized via the Block
  MDP problem. Existing algorithms suffer from either 1) computational intractability,
  2) strong statistical assumptions that are not necessarily satisfied in practice,
  or 3) suboptimal sample complexity. We address these issues by providing the first
  computationally efficient algorithm that attains rate-optimal sample complexity
  with respect to the desired accuracy level, with minimal statistical assumptions.
  Our algorithm, MusIK, combines exploration with representation learning based on
  multi-step inverse kinematics, a learning objective in which the aim is to predict
  the current action from the current observation and observations in the (potentially
  distant) future. MusIK is simple and flexible, and can efficiently take advantage
  of general-purpose function approximation. Our analysis of MusIK leverages several
  new techniques tailored to non-optimistic algorithms for reward-free exploration,
  which we anticipate will find broader use.
