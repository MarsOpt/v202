title: On the Privacy-Robustness-Utility Trilemma in Distributed Learning
openreview: 5WxdnjlCv7
abstract: The ubiquity of distributed machine learning (ML) in sensitive public domain
  applications calls for algorithms that protect data privacy, while being robust
  to faults and adversarial behaviors. Although privacy and robustness have been extensively
  studied independently in distributed ML, their synthesis remains poorly understood.
  We present the first tight analysis of the error incurred by any algorithm ensuring
  robustness against a fraction of adversarial machines, as well as differential privacy
  (DP) for honest machinesâ€™ data against any other curious entity. Our analysis exhibits
  a fundamental trade-off between privacy, robustness, and utility. To prove our lower
  bound, we consider the case of mean estimation, subject to distributed DP and robustness
  constraints, and devise reductions to centralized estimation of one-way marginals.
  We prove our matching upper bound by presenting a new distributed ML algorithm using
  a high-dimensional robust aggregation rule. The latter amortizes the dependence
  on the dimension in the error (caused by adversarial workers and DP), while being
  agnostic to the statistical properties of the data.
