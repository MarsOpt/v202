title: 'Online Learning with Feedback Graphs: The True Shape of Regret'
openreview: VVkeeSBUuh
abstract: Sequential learning with feedback graphs is a natural extension of the multi-armed
  bandit problem where the problem is equipped with an underlying graph structure
  that provides additional information - playing an action reveals the losses of all
  the neighbors of the action. This problem was introduced by Mannor & Shamir (2011)
  and received considerable attention in recent years. It is generally stated in the
  literature that the minimax regret rate for this problem is of order $\sqrt{\alpha
  T}$, where $\alpha$ is the independence number of the graph, and $T$ is the time
  horizon. However, this is proven only when the number of rounds $T$ is larger than
  $\alpha^3$, which poses a significant restriction for the usability of this result
  in large graphs. In this paper, we define a new quantity $R^*$, called the <em>problem
  complexity</em>, and prove that the minimax regret is proportional to $R^*$ for
  any graph and time horizon $T$. Introducing an intricate exploration strategy, we
  define the Exp3-EX algorithm that achieves the minimax optimal regret bound and
  becomes the first provably optimal algorithm for this setting, even if $T$ is smaller
  than $\alpha^3$.
