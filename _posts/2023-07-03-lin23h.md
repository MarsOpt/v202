title: Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning with Real-Time Budget Constraints
openreview: jrYVLd3wqk
abstract: Aiming at promoting the safe real-world deployment of Reinforcement Learning
  (RL), research on safe RL has made significant progress in recent years. However,
  most existing works in the literature still focus on the online setting where risky
  violations of the safety budget are likely to be incurred during training. Besides,
  in many realworld applications, the learned policy is required to respond to dynamically
  determined safety budgets (i.e., constraint threshold) in real time. In this paper,
  we target at the above real-time budget constraint problem under the offline setting,
  and propose Trajectory-based REal-time Budget Inference (TREBI) as a novel solution
  that approaches this problem from the perspective of trajectory distribution. Theoretically,
  we prove an error bound of the estimation on the episodic reward and cost under
  the offline setting and thus provide a performance guarantee for TREBI. Empirical
  results on a wide range of simulation tasks and a real-world large-scale advertising
  application demonstrate the capability of TREBI in solving real-time budget constraint
  problems under offline settings.
