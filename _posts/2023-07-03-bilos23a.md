title: Modeling Temporal Data as Continuous Functions with Stochastic Process Diffusion
openreview: OUWckW2g3j
abstract: Temporal data such as time series can be viewed as discretized measurements
  of the underlying function. To build a generative model for such data we have to
  model the stochastic process that governs it. We propose a solution by defining
  the denoising diffusion model in the function space which also allows us to naturally
  handle irregularly-sampled observations. The forward process gradually adds noise
  to functions, preserving their continuity, while the learned reverse process removes
  the noise and returns functions as new samples. To this end, we define suitable
  noise sources and introduce novel denoising and score-matching models. We show how
  our method can be used for multivariate probabilistic forecasting and imputation,
  and how our model can be interpreted as a neural process.
