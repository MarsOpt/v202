title: On Distribution Dependent Sub-Logarithmic Query Time of Learned Indexing
openreview: 4hefw3y2VK
abstract: A fundamental problem in data management is to find the elements in an array
  that match a query. Recently, learned indexes are being extensively used to solve
  this problem, where they learn a model to predict the location of the items in the
  array. They are empirically shown to outperform non-learned methods (e.g., B-trees
  or binary search that answer queries in $O(\log n)$ time) by orders of magnitude.
  However, success of learned indexes has not been theoretically justified. Only existing
  attempt shows the same query time of $O(\log n)$, but with a constant factor improvement
  in space complexity over non-learned methods, under some assumptions on data distribution.
  In this paper, we significantly strengthen this result, showing that under mild
  assumptions on data distribution, and the same space complexity as non-learned methods,
  learned indexes can answer queries in $O(\log\log n)$ expected query time. We also
  show that allowing for slightly larger but still near-linear space overhead, a learned
  index can achieve $O(1)$ expected query time. Our results theoretically prove learned
  indexes are orders of magnitude faster than non-learned methods, theoretically grounding
  their empirical success.
