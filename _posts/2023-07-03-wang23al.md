title: Optimal Goal-Reaching Reinforcement Learning via Quasimetric Learning
openreview: VLmf5fqWdf
abstract: In goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL), the optimal value function
  has a particular geometry, called quasimetrics structure. This paper introduces
  Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL), a new RL method that utilizes quasimetric
  models to learn optimal value functions. Distinct from prior approaches, the QRL
  objective is specifically designed for quasimetrics, and provides strong theoretical
  recovery guarantees. Empirically, we conduct thorough analyses on a discretized
  MountainCar environment, identifying properties of QRL and its advantages over alternatives.
  On offline and online goal-reaching benchmarks, QRL also demonstrates improved sample
  efficiency and performance, across both state-based and image-based observations.
