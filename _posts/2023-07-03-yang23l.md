title: Efficient Algorithms for Exact Graph Matching on Correlated Stochastic Block
  Models with Constant Correlation
openreview: 5yWTeqwv8t
abstract: We consider the problem of graph matching, or learning vertex correspondence,
  between two correlated stochastic block models (SBMs). The graph matching problem
  arises in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing
  and bioinformatics, and in particular, matching graphs with inherent community structure
  has significance related to de-anonymization of correlated social networks. Compared
  to the correlated Erdos-Renyi (ER) model, where various efficient algorithms have
  been developed, among which a few algorithms have been proven to achieve the exact
  matching with constant edge correlation, no low-order polynomial algorithm has been
  known to achieve exact matching for the correlated SBMs with constant correlation.
  In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for matching graphs with community
  structure, based on the comparison between partition trees rooted from each vertex,
  by extending the idea of Mao et al. (2021) to graphs with communities. The partition
  tree divides the large neighborhoods of each vertex into disjoint subsets using
  their edge statistics to different communities. Our algorithm is the first low-order
  polynomial-time algorithm achieving exact matching between two correlated SBMs with
  high probability in dense graphs.
