title: 'On Over-Squashing in Message Passing Neural Networks: The Impact of Width,
  Depth, and Topology'
openreview: t2tTfWwAEl
abstract: 'Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are instances of Graph Neural Networks
  that leverage the graph to send messages over the edges. This inductive bias leads
  to a phenomenon known as over-squashing, where a node feature is insensitive to
  information contained at distant nodes. Despite recent methods introduced to mitigate
  this issue, an understanding of the causes for over-squashing and of possible solutions
  are lacking. In this theoretical work, we prove that: (i) Neural network width can
  mitigate over-squashing, but at the cost of making the whole network more sensitive;
  (ii) Conversely, depth cannot help mitigate over-squashing: increasing the number
  of layers leads to over-squashing being dominated by vanishing gradients; (iii)
  The graph topology plays the greatest role, since over-squashing occurs between
  nodes at high commute time. Our analysis provides a unified framework to study different
  recent methods introduced to cope with over-squashing and serves as a justification
  for a class of methods that fall under graph rewiring.'
