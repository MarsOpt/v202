title: Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory
openreview: PKrDN23Rke
abstract: Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources
  salient to a given task—such as classification and generative modeling—poses a fundamental
  challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of
  brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden
  of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the
  parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead
  take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building
  block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of
  our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the
  input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a
  dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of
  convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.
  Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer
  parameters, and maintains at most a $O(N \log N)$ memory footprint for a length
  $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance
  on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks
  using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.
