title: How Bad is Top-$K$ Recommendation under Competing Content Creators?
openreview: XAK3238obr
abstract: This study explores the impact of content creators’ competition on user
  welfare in recommendation platforms, as well as the long-term dynamics of relevance-driven
  recommendations. We establish a model of creator competition, under the setting
  where the platform uses a top-$K$ recommendation policy, user decisions are guided
  by the Random Utility model, and creators, in absence of explicit utility functions,
  employ arbitrary no-regret learning algorithms for strategy updates. We study the
  user welfare guarantee through the lens of Price of Anarchy and show that the fraction
  of user welfare loss due to creator competition is always upper bounded by a small
  constant depending on $K$ and randomness in user decisions; we also prove the tightness
  of this bound. Our result discloses an intrinsic merit of the relevance-driven recommendation
  policy, as long as users’ decisions involve randomness and the platform provides
  reasonably many alternatives to its users.
