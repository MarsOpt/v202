title: Federated Online and Bandit Convex Optimization
openreview: mi7pnouqLa
abstract: We study the problems of <em>distributed online and bandit convex optimization</em>
  against an adaptive adversary. We aim to minimize the average regret on $M$ machines
  working in parallel over $T$ rounds with $R$ intermittent communications. Assuming
  the underlying cost functions are convex and can be generated adaptively, our results
  show that <em>collaboration is not beneficial when the machines have access to the
  first-order gradient information at the queried points</em>. This is in contrast
  to the case for stochastic functions, where each machine samples the cost functions
  from a fixed distribution. Furthermore, we delve into the more challenging setting
  of <em>federated online optimization with bandit (zeroth-order) feedback</em>, where
  the machines can only access values of the cost functions at the queried points.
  The key finding here is <em>identifying the high-dimensional regime where collaboration
  is beneficial and may even lead to a linear speedup in the number of machines</em>.
  We further illustrate our findings through federated adversarial linear bandits
  by developing novel distributed single and two-point feedback algorithms. Our work
  is the first attempt towards a systematic understanding of federated online optimization
  with limited feedback, and it attains tight regret bounds in the intermittent communication
  setting for both first and zeroth-order feedback. Our results thus bridge the gap
  between stochastic and adaptive settings in federated online optimization.
