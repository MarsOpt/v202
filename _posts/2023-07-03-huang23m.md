title: 'NeuralStagger: Accelerating Physics-constrained Neural PDE Solver with Spatial-temporal
  Decomposition'
openreview: YeDBpVhq4M
abstract: Neural networks have shown great potential in accelerating the solution
  of partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, there has been a growing interest
  in introducing physics constraints into training neural PDE solvers to reduce the
  use of costly data and improve the generalization ability. However, these physics
  constraints, based on certain finite dimensional approximations over the function
  space, must resolve the smallest scaled physics to ensure the accuracy and stability
  of the simulation, resulting in high computational costs from large input, output,
  and neural networks. This paper proposes a general acceleration methodology called
  NeuralStagger by spatially and temporally decomposing the original learning tasks
  into several coarser-resolution subtasks. We define a coarse-resolution neural solver
  for each subtask, which requires fewer computational resources, and jointly train
  them with the vanilla physics-constrained loss by simply arranging their outputs
  to reconstruct the original solution. Due to the perfect parallelism between them,
  the solution is achieved as fast as a coarse-resolution neural solver. In addition,
  the trained solvers bring the flexibility of simulating with multiple levels of
  resolution. We demonstrate the successful application of NeuralStagger on 2D and
  3D fluid dynamics simulations, which leads to an additional $10\sim100\times$ speed-up.
  Moreover, the experiment also shows that the learned model could be well used for
  optimal control.
