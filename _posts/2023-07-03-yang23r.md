title: Neural Prediction Errors enable Analogical Visual Reasoning in Human Standard
  Intelligence Tests
openreview: jTfTEdIPYu
abstract: Deep neural networks have long been criticized for lacking the ability to
  perform analogical visual reasoning. Here, we propose a neural network model to
  solve Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices (RPM) - one of the standard intelligence tests
  in human psychology. Specifically, we design a reasoning block based on the well-known
  concept of prediction error (PE) in neuroscience. Our reasoning block uses convolution
  to extract abstract rules from high-level visual features of the 8 context images
  and generates the features of a predicted answer. PEs are then calculated between
  the predicted features and those of the 8 candidate answers, and are then passed
  to the next stage. We further integrate our novel reasoning blocks into a residual
  network and build a new Predictive Reasoning Network (PredRNet). Extensive experiments
  show that our proposed PredRNet achieves state-of-the-art average performance on
  several important RPM benchmarks. PredRNet also shows good generalization abilities
  in a variety of out-of-distribution scenarios and other visual reasoning tasks.
  Most importantly, our PredRNet forms low-dimensional representations of abstract
  rules and minimizes hierarchical prediction errors during model training, supporting
  the critical role of PE minimization in visual reasoning. Our work highlights the
  potential of using neuroscience theories to solve abstract visual reasoning problems
  in artificial intelligence. The code is available at https://github.com/ZjjConan/AVR-PredRNet.
