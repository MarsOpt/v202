title: On the Importance of Feature Decorrelation for Unsupervised Representation
  Learning in Reinforcement Learning
openreview: PqUQBWE1VC
abstract: Recently, unsupervised representation learning (URL) has improved the sample
  efficiency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) by pretraining a model from a large unlabeled
  dataset. The underlying principle of these methods is to learn temporally predictive
  representations by predicting future states in the latent space. However, an important
  challenge of this approach is the representational collapse, where the subspace
  of the latent representations collapses into a low-dimensional manifold. To address
  this issue, we propose a novel URL framework that causally predicts future states
  while increasing the dimension of the latent manifold by decorrelating the features
  in the latent space. Through extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate that our
  framework effectively learns predictive representations without collapse, which
  significantly improves the sample efficiency of state-of-the-art URL methods on
  the Atari 100k benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/dojeon-ai/SimTPR.
