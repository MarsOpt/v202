title: 'Returning The Favour: When Regression Benefits From Probabilistic Causal Knowledge'
openreview: Q3Rmfuj4vf
abstract: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) provides valuable prior knowledge that is
  often discarded in regression tasks in machine learning. We show that the independences
  arising from the presence of collider structures in DAGs provide meaningful inductive
  biases, which constrain the regression hypothesis space and improve predictive performance.
  We introduce collider regression, a framework to incorporate probabilistic causal
  knowledge from a collider in a regression problem. When the hypothesis space is
  a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we prove a strictly positive generalisation
  benefit under mild assumptions and provide closed-form estimators of the empirical
  risk minimiser. Experiments on synthetic and climate model data demonstrate performance
  gains of the proposed methodology.
