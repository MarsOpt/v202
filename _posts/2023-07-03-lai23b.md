title: 'DS-1000: A Natural and Reliable Benchmark for Data Science Code Generation'
openreview: WszMYJdo0p
abstract: We introduce DS-1000, a code generation benchmark with a thousand data science
  problems spanning seven Python libraries, such as Numpy and Pandas. Compared to
  prior works, DS-1000 incorporates three core features. First, our problems reflect
  diverse, realistic, and practical use cases since we collected them from StackOverflow.
  Second, our automatic evaluation is highly specific (reliable) â€“ across all Codex-002-predicted
  solutions that our evaluation accepts, only 1.8% of them are incorrect; we achieve
  this with multi-criteria metrics, checking both functional correctness by running
  test cases and surface-form constraints by restricting API usages or keywords. Finally,
  we proactively defend against memorization by slightly modifying our problems to
  be different from the original StackOverflow source; consequently, models cannot
  answer them correctly by memorizing the solutions from pre-training. The current
  best public system (Codex-002) achieves 43.3% accuracy, leaving ample room for improvement.
  We release our benchmark at https://ds1000-code-gen.github.io.
