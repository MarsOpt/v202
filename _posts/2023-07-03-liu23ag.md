title: Generating Private Synthetic Data with Genetic Algorithms
openreview: B9R1uLC1B1
abstract: We study the problem of efficiently generating differentially private synthetic
  data that approximate the statistical properties of an underlying sensitive dataset.
  In recent years, there has been a growing line of work that approaches this problem
  using first-order optimization techniques. However, such techniques are restricted
  to optimizing differentiable objectives only, severely limiting the types of analyses
  that can be conducted. For example, first-order mechanisms have been primarily successful
  in approximating statistical queries only in the form of marginals for discrete
  data domains. In some cases, one can circumvent such issues by relaxing the taskâ€™s
  objective to maintain differentiability. However, even when possible, these approaches
  impose a fundamental limitation in which modifications to the minimization problem
  become additional sources of error. Therefore, we propose Private-GSD, a private
  genetic algorithm based on <em>zeroth</em>-order optimization heuristics that do
  not require modifying the original objective; thus, it avoids the aforementioned
  limitations of first-order optimization. We demonstrate empirically that on data
  with both discrete and real-valued attributes, Private-GSD outperforms the state-of-the-art
  methods on non-differential queries while matching accuracy in approximating differentiable
  ones.
