title: Which Tricks are Important for Learning to Rank?
openreview: MXfTQp8bZF
abstract: Nowadays, state-of-the-art learning-to-rank methods are based on gradient-boosted
  decision trees (GBDT). The most well-known algorithm is LambdaMART which was proposed
  more than a decade ago. Recently, several other GBDT-based ranking algorithms were
  proposed. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze these methods in a unified setup.
  In particular, we address the following questions. Is direct optimization of a smoothed
  ranking loss preferable over optimizing a convex surrogate? How to properly construct
  and smooth surrogate ranking losses? To address these questions, we compare LambdaMART
  with YetiRank and StochasticRank methods and their modifications. We also propose
  a simple improvement of the YetiRank approach that allows for optimizing specific
  ranking loss functions. As a result, we gain insights into learning-to-rank techniques
  and obtain a new state-of-the-art algorithm.
