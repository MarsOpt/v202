title: Infinite Action Contextual Bandits with Reusable Data Exhaust
openreview: Ozx3OCAfDf
abstract: 'For infinite action contextual bandits, smoothed regret and reduction to
  regression results in state-of-the-art online performance with computational cost
  independent of the action set: unfortunately, the resulting data exhaust does not
  have well-defined importance-weights. This frustrates the execution of downstream
  data science processes such as offline model selection. In this paper we describe
  an online algorithm with an equivalent smoothed regret guarantee, but which generates
  well-defined importance weights: in exchange, the online computational cost increases,
  but only to order smoothness (i.e., still independent of the action set). This removes
  a key obstacle to adoption of smoothed regret in production scenarios.'
