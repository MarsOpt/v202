title: High Probability Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Methods
openreview: Q9SeUwcdfQ
abstract: In this work, we describe a generic approach to show convergence with high
  probability for both stochastic convex and non-convex optimization with sub-Gaussian
  noise. In previous works for convex optimization, either the convergence is only
  in expectation or the bound depends on the diameter of the domain. Instead, we show
  high probability convergence with bounds depending on the initial distance to the
  optimal solution. The algorithms use step sizes analogous to the standard settings
  and are universal to Lipschitz functions, smooth functions, and their linear combinations.
  The method can be applied to the non-convex case. We demonstrate an $O((1+\sigma^{2}\log(1/\delta))/T+\sigma/\sqrt{T})$
  convergence rate when the number of iterations $T$ is known and an $O((1+\sigma^{2}\log(T/\delta))/\sqrt{T})$
  convergence rate when $T$ is unknown for SGD, where $1-\delta$ is the desired success
  probability. These bounds improve over existing bounds in the literature. We also
  revisit AdaGrad-Norm (Ward et al., 2019) and show a new analysis to obtain a high
  probability bound that does not require the bounded gradient assumption made in
  previous works. The full version of our paper contains results for the standard
  per-coordinate AdaGrad.
