title: Bilevel Optimization with Coupled Decision-Dependent Distributions
openreview: UOVrBJXId2
abstract: Bilevel optimization has gained significant popularity in recent years due
  to its ability to formulate various machine learning problems. For instance, in
  meta-learning, the upper-level (UL) problem offers a good initialization for the
  lower-level (LL) model to facilitate adaptation. However, the decision variables
  can impact data features and outcomes, leading to the phenomenon known as performativity.
  In this work, we investigate the inclusion of decision-dependent distributions in
  bilevel optimization. Specifically, we consider the scenarios where the UL data
  distribution depends on the LL optimization variable, and the LL data distribution
  also depends on the UL decision variable. We first establish sufficient conditions
  for the existence of performatively stable (PS) solutions in this class of bilevel
  problems. Also, we propose efficient stochastic algorithms to find the PS point
  with theoretical convergence rate analysis and discuss the theoretical optimality
  of the obtained solution. Our theoretical analysis is corroborated through a series
  of numerical experiments, wherein we evaluate the performance of the bilevel performative
  prediction algorithms alongside non-performative counterparts in the context of
  meta strategic learning problems.
