title: Surface Snapping Optimization Layer for Single Image Object Shape Reconstruction
openreview: C8ijRC4ZvS
abstract: Reconstructing the 3D shape of objects observed in a single image is a challenging
  task. Recent approaches rely on visual cues extracted from a given image learned
  from a deep net. In this work, we leverage recent advances in monocular scene understanding
  to incorporate an additional geometric cue of surface normals. For this, we proposed
  a novel optimization layer that encourages the face normals of the reconstructed
  shape to be aligned with estimated surface normals. We develop a computationally
  efficient conjugate-gradient-based method that avoids the computation of a high-dimensional
  sparse matrix. We show this framework to achieve compelling shape reconstruction
  results on the challenging Pix3D and ShapeNet datasets.
