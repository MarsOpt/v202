title: Computational Doob h-transforms for Online Filtering of Discretely Observed
  Diffusions
openreview: HafOgQ1zW2
abstract: This paper is concerned with online filtering of discretely observed nonlinear
  diffusion processes. Our approach is based on the fully adapted auxiliary particle
  filter, which involves Doobâ€™s $h$-transforms that are typically intractable. We
  propose a computational framework to approximate these $h$-transforms by solving
  the underlying backward Kolmogorov equations using nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulas
  and neural networks. The methodology allows one to train a locally optimal particle
  filter prior to the data-assimilation procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate
  that the proposed approach can be orders of magnitude more efficient than state-of-the-art
  particle filters in the regime of highly informative observations, when the observations
  are extreme under the model, and if the state dimension is large.
