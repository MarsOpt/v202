title: Drug Discovery under Covariate Shift with Domain-Informed Prior Distributions
  over Functions
openreview: BbZVFj0QPv
abstract: Accelerating the discovery of novel and more effective therapeutics is an
  important pharmaceutical problem in which deep learning is playing an increasingly
  significant role. However, real-world drug discovery tasks are often characterized
  by a scarcity of labeled data and significant covariate shiftâ€”a setting that poses
  a challenge to standard deep learning methods. In this paper, we present Q-SAVI,
  a probabilistic model able to address these challenges by encoding explicit prior
  knowledge of the data-generating process into a prior distribution over functions,
  presenting researchers with a transparent and probabilistically principled way to
  encode data-driven modeling preferences. Building on a novel, gold-standard bioactivity
  dataset that facilitates a meaningful comparison of models in an extrapolative regime,
  we explore different approaches to induce data shift and construct a challenging
  evaluation setup. We then demonstrate that using Q-SAVI to integrate contextualized
  prior knowledge of drug-like chemical space into the modeling process affords substantial
  gains in predictive accuracy and calibration, outperforming a broad range of state-of-the-art
  self-supervised pre-training and domain adaptation techniques.
