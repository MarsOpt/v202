title: Polyhedral Complex Extraction from ReLU Networks using Edge Subdivision
openreview: F2OjOG4j55
abstract: A neural network consisting of piecewise affine building blocks, such as
  fully-connected layers and ReLU activations, is itself a piecewise affine function
  supported on a polyhedral complex. This complex has been previously studied to characterize
  theoretical properties of neural networks, but, in practice, extracting it remains
  a challenge due to its high combinatorial complexity. A natural idea described in
  previous works is to subdivide the regions via intersections with hyperplanes induced
  by each neuron. However, we argue that this view leads to computational redundancy.
  Instead of regions, we propose to subdivide edges, leading to a novel method for
  polyhedral complex extraction. A key to this are sign-vectors, which encode the
  combinatorial structure of the complex. Our approach allows to use standard tensor
  operations on a GPU, taking seconds for millions of cells on a consumer grade machine.
  Motivated by the growing interest in neural shape representation, we use the speed
  and differentiablility of our method to optimize geometric properties of the complex.
