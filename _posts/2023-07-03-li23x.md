title: Deep Anomaly Detection under Labeling Budget Constraints
openreview: VjopP4ejwB
abstract: Selecting informative data points for expert feedback can significantly
  improve the performance of anomaly detection (AD) in various contexts, such as medical
  diagnostics or fraud detection. In this paper, we determine a set of theoretical
  conditions under which anomaly scores generalize from labeled queries to unlabeled
  data. Motivated by these results, we propose a data labeling strategy with optimal
  data coverage under labeling budget constraints. In addition, we propose a new learning
  framework for semi-supervised AD. Extensive experiments on image, tabular, and video
  data sets show that our approach results in state-of-the-art semi-supervised AD
  performance under labeling budget constraints.
