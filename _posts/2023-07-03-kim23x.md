title: Learnability and Algorithm for Continual Learning
openreview: v2Xv1EbBkH
abstract: This paper studies the challenging continual learning (CL) setting of Class
  Incremental Learning (CIL). CIL learns a sequence of tasks consisting of disjoint
  sets of concepts or classes. At any time, a single model is built that can be applied
  to predict/classify test instances of any classes learned thus far without providing
  any task related information for each test instance. Although many techniques have
  been proposed for CIL, they are mostly empirical. It has been shown recently that
  a strong CIL system needs a strong within-task prediction (WP) and a strong out-of-distribution
  (OOD) detection for each task. However, it is still not known whether CIL is actually
  learnable. This paper shows that CIL is learnable. Based on the theory, a new CIL
  algorithm is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.
