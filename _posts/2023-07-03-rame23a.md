title: 'Model Ratatouille: Recycling Diverse Models for Out-of-Distribution Generalization'
openreview: EnW6Fsp1oP
abstract: 'Foundation models are redefining how AI systems are built. Practitioners
  now follow a standard procedure to build their machine learning solutions: from
  a pre-trained foundation model, they fine-tune the weights on the target task of
  interest. So, the Internet is swarmed by a handful of foundation models fine-tuned
  on many diverse tasks: these individual fine-tunings exist in isolation without
  benefiting from each other. In our opinion, this is a missed opportunity, as these
  specialized models contain rich and diverse features. In this paper, we thus propose
  model ratatouille, a new strategy to recycle the multiple fine-tunings of the same
  foundation model on diverse auxiliary tasks. Specifically, we repurpose these auxiliary
  weights as initializations for multiple parallel fine-tunings on the target task;
  then, we average all fine-tuned weights to obtain the final model. This recycling
  strategy aims at maximizing the diversity in weights by leveraging the diversity
  in auxiliary tasks. Empirically, it improves the state of the art on the reference
  DomainBed benchmark for out-of-distribution generalization. Looking forward, this
  work contributes to the emerging paradigm of updatable machine learning where, akin
  to open-source software development, the community collaborates to reliably update
  machine learning models.'
