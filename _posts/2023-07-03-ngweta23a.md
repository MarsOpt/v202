title: Simple Disentanglement of Style and Content in Visual Representations
openreview: oupdxuURWD
abstract: Learning visual representations with interpretable features, i.e., disentangled
  representations, remains a challenging problem. Existing methods demonstrate some
  success but are hard to apply to large-scale vision datasets like ImageNet. In this
  work, we propose a simple post-processing framework to disentangle content and style
  in learned representations from pre-trained vision models. We model the pre-trained
  features probabilistically as linearly entangled combinations of the latent content
  and style factors and develop a simple disentanglement algorithm based on the probabilistic
  model. We show that the method provably disentangles content and style features
  and verify its efficacy empirically. Our post-processed features yield significant
  domain generalization performance improvements when the distribution shift occurs
  due to style changes or style-related spurious correlations.
