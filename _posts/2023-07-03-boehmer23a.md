title: 'Subset Selection Based On Multiple Rankings in the Presence of Bias: Effectiveness
  of Fairness Constraints for Multiwinner Voting Score Functions'
openreview: H8WXqZ7VZn
abstract: 'We consider the problem of subset selection where one is given multiple
  rankings of items and the goal is to select the highest "quality" subset. Score
  functions from the multiwinner voting literature have been used to aggregate rankings
  into quality scores for subsets. We study this setting of subset selection problems
  when, in addition, rankings may contain systemic or unconscious biases toward a
  group of items. For a general model of input rankings and biases, we show that requiring
  the selected subset to satisfy group fairness constraints can improve the quality
  of the selection with respect to unbiased rankings. Importantly, we show that for
  fairness constraints to be effective, different multiwinner score functions may
  require a drastically different number of rankings: While for some functions, fairness
  constraints need an exponential number of rankings to recover a close-to-optimal
  solution, for others, this dependency is only polynomial. This result relies on
  a novel notion of "smoothness" of submodular functions in this setting that quantifies
  how well a function can "correctly" assess the quality of items in the presence
  of bias. The results in this paper can be used to guide the choice of multiwinner
  score functions for the subset selection setting considered here; we additionally
  provide a tool to empirically enable this.'
