title: Learning Globally Smooth Functions on Manifolds
openreview: 4bNGE4WSfJ
abstract: Smoothness and low dimensional structures play central roles in improving
  generalization and stability in learning and statistics. This work combines techniques
  from semi-infinite constrained learning and manifold regularization to learn representations
  that are globally smooth on a manifold. To do so, it shows that under typical conditions
  the problem of learning a Lipschitz continuous function on a manifold is equivalent
  to a dynamically weighted manifold regularization problem. This observation leads
  to a practical algorithm based on a weighted Laplacian penalty whose weights are
  adapted using stochastic gradient techniques. It is shown that under mild conditions,
  this method estimates the Lipschitz constant of the solution, learning a globally
  smooth solution as a byproduct. Experiments on real world data illustrate the advantages
  of the proposed method relative to existing alternatives. Our code is available
