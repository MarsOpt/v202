title: Proximal Causal Learning of Conditional Average Treatment Effects
openreview: Fq03w1f6hy
abstract: Efficiently and flexibly estimating treatment effect heterogeneity is an
  important task in a wide variety of settings ranging from medicine to marketing,
  and there are a considerable number of promising conditional average treatment effect
  estimators currently available. These, however, typically rely on the assumption
  that the measured covariates are enough to justify conditional exchangeability.
  We propose the P-learner, motivated by the R- and DR-learner, a tailored two-stage
  loss function for learning heterogeneous treatment effects in settings where exchangeability
  given observed covariates is an implausible assumption, and we wish to rely on proxy
  variables for causal inference. Our proposed estimator can be implemented by off-the-shelf
  loss-minimizing machine learning methods, which in the case of kernel regression
  satisfies an oracle bound on the estimated error as long as the nuisance components
  are estimated reasonably well.
