title: Constrained Optimization via Exact Augmented Lagrangian and Randomized Iterative
  Sketching
openreview: oxS8hNmCuW
abstract: We consider solving equality-constrained nonlinear, nonconvex optimization
  problems. This class of problems appears widely in a variety of applications in
  machine learning and engineering, ranging from constrained deep neural networks,
  to optimal control, to PDE-constrained optimization. We develop an adaptive inexact
  Newton method for this problem class. In each iteration, we solve the Lagrangian
  Newton system inexactly via a randomized iterative sketching solver, and select
  a suitable stepsize by performing line search on an exact augmented Lagrangian merit
  function. The randomized solvers have advantages over deterministic linear system
  solvers by significantly reducing per-iteration flops complexity and storage cost,
  when equipped with suitable sketching matrices. Our method adaptively controls the
  accuracy of the randomized solver and the penalty parameters of the exact augmented
  Lagrangian, to ensure that the inexact Newton direction is a descent direction of
  the exact augmented Lagrangian. This allows us to establish a global almost sure
  convergence. We also show that a unit stepsize is admissible locally, so that our
  method exhibits a local linear convergence. Furthermore, we prove that the linear
  convergence can be strengthened to superlinear convergence if we gradually sharpen
  the adaptive accuracy condition on the randomized solver. We demonstrate the superior
  performance of our method on benchmark nonlinear problems in CUTEst test set, constrained
  logistic regression with data from LIBSVM, and a PDE-constrained problem.
