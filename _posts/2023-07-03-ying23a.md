title: Adaptive Estimation of Graphical Models under Total Positivity
openreview: USiX9gmGRx
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating (diagonally dominant) M-matrices as
  precision matrices in Gaussian graphical models. Such models have shown interesting
  properties, e.g., the maximum likelihood estimator exists with as little as two
  observations in the case of M-matrices, and exists even with one observation in
  the case of diagonally dominant M-matrices. We propose an adaptive multiple-stage
  estimation method, which refines the estimate by solving a weighted $\ell_1$-regularized
  problem in each stage. We further design a unified framework based on gradient projection
  method to solve the regularized problem, equipped with different projections to
  handle the constraints of M-matrices and diagonally dominant M-matrices. Theoretical
  analysis of the estimation error is established. The proposed method outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods in estimating precision matrices and identifying graph
  edges, as evidenced by synthetic and financial time-series data sets.
