title: Using Large Language Models to Simulate Multiple Humans and Replicate Human
  Subject Studies
openreview: eYlLlvzngu
abstract: 'We introduce a new type of test, called a Turing Experiment (TE), for evaluating
  to what extent a given language model, such as GPT models, can simulate different
  aspects of human behavior. A TE can also reveal consistent distortions in a language
  model’s simulation of a specific human behavior. Unlike the Turing Test, which involves
  simulating a single arbitrary individual, a TE requires simulating a representative
  sample of participants in human subject research. We carry out TEs that attempt
  to replicate well-established findings from prior studies. We design a methodology
  for simulating TEs and illustrate its use to compare how well different language
  models are able to reproduce classic economic, psycholinguistic, and social psychology
  experiments: Ultimatum Game, Garden Path Sentences, Milgram Shock Experiment, and
  Wisdom of Crowds. In the first three TEs, the existing findings were replicated
  using recent models, while the last TE reveals a “hyper-accuracy distortion” present
  in some language models (including ChatGPT and GPT-4), which could affect downstream
  applications in education and the arts.'
