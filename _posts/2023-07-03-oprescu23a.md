title: 'B-Learner: Quasi-Oracle Bounds on Heterogeneous Causal Effects Under Hidden
  Confounding'
openreview: j5PYwPsNci
abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data is a
  crucial task across many fields, helping policy and decision-makers take better
  actions. There has been recent progress on robust and efficient methods for estimating
  the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function, but these methods often
  do not take into account the risk of hidden confounding, which could arbitrarily
  and unknowingly bias any causal estimate based on observational data. We propose
  a meta-learner called the B-Learner, which can efficiently learn sharp bounds on
  the CATE function under limits on the level of hidden confounding. We derive the
  B-Learner by adapting recent results for sharp and valid bounds of the average treatment
  effect (Dorn et al., 2021) into the framework given by Kallus & Oprescu (2023) for
  robust and model-agnostic learning of conditional distributional treatment effects.
  The B-Learner can use any function estimator such as random forests and deep neural
  networks, and we prove its estimates are valid, sharp, efficient, and have a quasi-oracle
  property with respect to the constituent estimators under more general conditions
  than existing methods. Semi-synthetic experimental comparisons validate the theoretical
  findings, and we use real-world data demonstrate how the method might be used in
  practice.
