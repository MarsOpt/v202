title: Automatic Data Augmentation via Invariance-Constrained Learning
openreview: akL5dawXhD
abstract: Underlying data structures, such as symmetries or invariance to transformations,
  are often exploited to improve the solution of learning tasks. However, embedding
  these properties in models or learning algorithms can be challenging and computationally
  intensive. Data augmentation, on the other hand, induces these symmetries during
  training by applying multiple transformations to the input data. Despite its ubiquity,
  its effectiveness depends on the choices of which transformations to apply, when
  to do so, and how often. In fact, there is both empirical and theoretical evidence
  that the indiscriminate use of data augmentation can introduce biases that outweigh
  its benefits. This work tackles these issues by automatically adapting the data
  augmentation while solving the learning task. To do so, it formulates data augmentation
  as an invariance constrained learning problem and leverages Monte Carlo Markov Chain
  (MCMC) sampling to solve it. The result is an algorithm that not only does away
  with a priori searches for augmentation distributions, but also dynamically controls
  if and when data augmentation is applied. We validate empirically our theoretical
  developments in automatic data augmentation benchmarks for CIFAR and ImageNet-100
  datasets. Furthermore, our experiments show how this approach can be used to gather
  insights on the actual symmetries underlying a learning task.
