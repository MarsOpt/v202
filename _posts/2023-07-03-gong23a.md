title: Learning Distributions over Quantum Measurement Outcomes
openreview: hdGyjAnqZG
abstract: 'Shadow tomography for quantum states provides a sample efficient approach
  for predicting the measurement outcomes of quantum systems. However, these shadow
  tomography procedures yield poor bounds if there are more than two outcomes per
  measurement. In this paper, we consider a general problem of learning properties
  from quantum states: given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$ and $M$
  unknown quantum measurements $\mathcal{M}_1,...,\mathcal{M}_M$ with $K\geq 2$ outcomes,
  estimating the probability distribution for applying $\mathcal{M}_i$ on $\rho$ to
  within total variation distance $\epsilon$. Compared to the special case when $K=2$,
  we have to learn unknown distributions instead of values. Here, we propose an online
  shadow tomography procedure that solves this problem with high success probability
  requiring $\tilde{O}(K\log^2M\log d/\epsilon^4)$ copies of $\rho$. We further prove
  an information-theoretic lower bound showing that at least $\Omega(\min\{d^2,K+\log
  M\}/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are required to solve this problem with high success
  probability. Our shadow tomography procedure requires sample complexity with only
  logarithmic dependence on $M$ and $d$ and is sample-optimal concerning the dependence
  on $K$.'
