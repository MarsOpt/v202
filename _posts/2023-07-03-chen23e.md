title: 'Restoration-Degradation Beyond Linear Diffusions: A Non-Asymptotic Analysis
  For DDIM-type Samplers'
openreview: GOUgXuLahg
abstract: 'We develop a framework for non-asymptotic analysis of deterministic samplers
  used for diffusion generative modeling. Several recent works have analyzed stochastic
  samplers using tools like Girsanovâ€™s theorem and a chain rule variant of the interpolation
  argument. Unfortunately, these techniques give vacuous bounds when applied to deterministic
  samplers. We give a new operational interpretation for deterministic sampling by
  showing that one step along the probability flow ODE can be expressed as two steps:
  1) a restoration step that runs gradient ascent on the conditional log-likelihood
  at some infinitesimally previous time, and 2) a degradation step that runs the forward
  process using noise pointing back towards the current iterate. This perspective
  allows us to extend denoising diffusion implicit models to general, non-linear forward
  processes. We then develop the first polynomial convergence bounds for these samplers
  under mild conditions on the data distribution.'
