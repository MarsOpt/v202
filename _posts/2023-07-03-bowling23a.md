title: Settling the Reward Hypothesis
openreview: GtoeseQjtY
abstract: The <em>reward hypothesis</em> posits that, "all of what we mean by goals
  and purposes can be well thought of as maximization of the expected value of the
  cumulative sum of a received scalar signal (reward)." We aim to fully settle this
  hypothesis. This will not conclude with a simple affirmation or refutation, but
  rather specify completely the implicit requirements on goals and purposes under
  which the hypothesis holds.
