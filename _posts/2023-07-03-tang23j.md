title: 'Difference-in-Differences Meets Tree-based Methods: Heterogeneous Treatment
  Effects Estimation with Unmeasured Confounding'
openreview: FdCeFHTXrS
abstract: This study considers the estimation of conditional causal effects in the
  presence of unmeasured confounding for a balanced panel with treatment imposed at
  the last time point. To address this, we combine Difference-in-differences (DiD)
  and tree-based methods and propose a new identification assumption that allows for
  the violation of the (conditional) parallel trends assumption adopted by most existing
  DiD methods. Under this new assumption, we prove partial identifiability of the
  conditional average treatment effect on the treated group (CATT). Our proposed method
  estimates CATT through a tree-based causal approach, guided by a novel splitting
  rule that avoids model misspecification and unnecessary auxiliary parameter estimation.
  The splitting rule measures both the error of fitting observed data and the violation
  of conditional parallel trends simultaneously. We also develop an ensemble of multiple
  trees via gradient boosting to further enhance performance. Experimental results
  on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed
  method.
