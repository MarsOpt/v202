title: 'SurProGenes: Survival Risk-Ordered Representation of Cancer Patients and Genes
  for the Identification of Prognostic Genes'
openreview: t4COq27gBs
abstract: Identifying prognostic genes associated with patient survival is an important
  goal in cancer genomics, as this information could inform treatment approaches and
  improve patient outcomes. However, the identification of prognostic genes is complicated
  by the high dimensionality of genetic data, which makes their identification computationally
  intensive. Furthermore, most cancer genomics studies lack appropriate low-risk groups
  against which to compare. To address these issues, we present a framework that identifies
  candidate prognostic genes by integrating representation learning and statistical
  analysis approaches. Specifically, we propose a collaborative filtering-derived
  mechanism to represent patients in order of their survival risk, facilitating their
  dichotomization. We also propose a mechanism that allows embedded gene vectors to
  be polarized on the extremities of, or centered on, both reference axes to facilitate
  recommendations. Restricting our analysis to a few representative genes within each
  cluster allowed for the efficient identification of prognostic genes. Finally, we
  demonstrate the potential of this proposed framework for identifying prognostic
  genes.
