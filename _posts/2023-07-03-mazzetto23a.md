title: Nonparametric Density Estimation under Distribution Drift
openreview: k5d0DhHayB
abstract: We study nonparametric density estimation in non-stationary drift settings.
  Given a sequence of independent samples taken from a distribution that gradually
  changes in time, the goal is to compute the best estimate for the current distribution.
  We prove tight minimax risk bounds for both discrete and continuous smooth densities,
  where the minimum is over all possible estimates and the maximum is over all possible
  distributions that satisfy the drift constraints. Our technique handles a broad
  class of drift models and generalizes previous results on agnostic learning under
  drift.
