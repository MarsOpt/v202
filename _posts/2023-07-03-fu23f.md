title: Meta-learning Parameterized Skills
openreview: Rg5CRU2M4Z
abstract: We propose a novel parameterized skill-learning algorithm that aims to learn
  transferable parameterized skills and synthesize them into a new action space that
  supports efficient learning in long-horizon tasks. We propose to leverage off-policy
  Meta-RL combined with a trajectory-centric smoothness term to learn a set of parameterized
  skills. Our agent can use these learned skills to construct a three-level hierarchical
  framework that models a Temporally-extended Parameterized Action Markov Decision
  Process. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed algorithms enable an agent
  to solve a set of highly difficult long-horizon (obstacle-course and robot manipulation)
  tasks.
