title: Optimality of Thompson Sampling with Noninformative Priors for Pareto Bandits
openreview: 5jVmnUEme5
abstract: In the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, a randomized probability matching
  policy called Thompson sampling (TS) has shown excellent performance in various
  reward models. In addition to the empirical performance, TS has been shown to achieve
  asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds in several models. However, its optimality
  has been mainly addressed under light-tailed or one-parameter models that belong
  to exponential families. In this paper, we consider the optimality of TS for the
  Pareto model that has a heavy tail and is parameterized by two unknown parameters.
  Specifically, we discuss the optimality of TS with probability matching priors that
  include the Jeffreys prior and the reference priors. We first prove that TS with
  certain probability matching priors can achieve the optimal regret bound. Then,
  we show the suboptimality of TS with other priors, including the Jeffreys and the
  reference priors. Nevertheless, we find that TS with the Jeffreys and reference
  priors can achieve the asymptotic lower bound if one uses a truncation procedure.
  These results suggest carefully choosing noninformative priors to avoid suboptimality
  and show the effectiveness of truncation procedures in TS-based policies.
