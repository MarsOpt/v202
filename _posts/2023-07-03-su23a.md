title: Towards Robust Graph Incremental Learning on Evolving Graphs
openreview: DdQ8ewIgY9
abstract: Incremental learning is a machine learning approach that involves training
  a model on a sequence of tasks, rather than all tasks at once. This ability to learn
  incrementally from a stream of tasks is crucial for many real-world applications.
  However, incremental learning is a challenging problem on graph-structured data,
  as many graph-related problems involve prediction tasks for each individual node,
  known as Node-wise Graph Incremental Learning (NGIL). This introduces non-independent
  and non-identically distributed characteristics in the sample data generation process,
  making it difficult to maintain the performance of the model as new tasks are added.
  In this paper, we focus on the inductive NGIL problem, which accounts for the evolution
  of graph structure (structural shift) induced by emerging tasks. We provide a formal
  formulation and analysis of the problem, and propose a novel regularization-based
  technique called Structural-Shift-Risk-Mitigation (SSRM) to mitigate the impact
  of the structural shift on catastrophic forgetting of the inductive NGIL problem.
  We show that the structural shift can lead to a shift in the input distribution
  for the existing tasks, and further lead to an increased risk of catastrophic forgetting.
  Through comprehensive empirical studies with several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
  that our proposed method, Structural-Shift-Risk-Mitigation (SSRM), is flexible and
  easy to adapt to improve the performance of state-of-the-art GNN incremental learning
  frameworks in the inductive setting.
