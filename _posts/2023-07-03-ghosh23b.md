title: Harmonic Neural Networks
openreview: qI0l2VKp7N
abstract: Harmonic functions are abundant in nature, appearing in limiting cases of
  Maxwellâ€™s, Navier-Stokes equations, the heat and the wave equation. Consequently,
  there are many applications of harmonic functions from industrial process optimisation
  to robotic path planning and the calculation of first exit times of random walks.
  Despite their ubiquity and relevance, there have been few attempts to incorporate
  inductive biases towards harmonic functions in machine learning contexts. In this
  work, we demonstrate effective means of representing harmonic functions in neural
  networks and extend such results also to quantum neural networks to demonstrate
  the generality of our approach. We benchmark our approaches against (quantum) physics-informed
  neural networks, where we show favourable performance.
