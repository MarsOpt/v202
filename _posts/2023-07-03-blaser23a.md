title: Not all Strongly Rayleigh Distributions Have Small Probabilistic Generating
  Circuits
openreview: KRaczWbPSF
abstract: Probabilistic modeling is a central task in machine learning. Probabilistic
  models should be tractable, i.e., allowing tractable probabilistic inference, but
  also efficient, i.e., being able to represent a large set of probability distributions.
  Zhang et al. (ICML 2021) recently proposed a new model, probabilistic generating
  circuits. They raised the question whether every strongly Rayleigh distribution
  can be efficiently represented by such circuits. We prove that this question has
  a negative answer, there are strongly Rayleigh distributions that cannot be represented
  by polynomial-sized probabilistic generating circuits, assuming a widely accepted
  complexity theoretic conjecture.
