title: Adaptive Computation with Elastic Input Sequence
openreview: 2bGTacOn8v
abstract: Humans have the ability to adapt the type of information they use, the procedure
  they employ, and the amount of time they spend when solving problems. However, most
  standard neural networks have a fixed function type and computation budget regardless
  of the sampleâ€™s nature or difficulty. Adaptivity is a powerful paradigm as it not
  only imbues practitioners with flexibility pertaining to the downstream usage of
  these models but can also serve as a powerful inductive bias for solving certain
  challenging classes of problems. In this work, we introduce a new approach called
  AdaTape, which allows for dynamic computation in neural networks through adaptive
  tape tokens. AdaTape utilizes an elastic input sequence by equipping an architecture
  with a dynamic read-and-write tape. Specifically, we adaptively generate input sequences
  using tape tokens obtained from a tape bank which can be either trainable or derived
  from input data. We examine the challenges and requirements to obtain dynamic sequence
  content and length, and propose the Adaptive Tape Reading (ATR) algorithm to achieve
  both goals. Through extensive experiments on image recognition tasks, we show that
  AdaTape can achieve better performance while maintaining the computational cost.
  To facilitate further research, we have released code at https://github.com/google-research/scenic/tree/main/scenic/projects/adatape.
