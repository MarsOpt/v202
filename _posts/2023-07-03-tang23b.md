title: Regret-Minimizing Double Oracle for Extensive-Form Games
openreview: dHHWXFbSR7
abstract: By incorporating regret minimization, double oracle methods have demonstrated
  rapid convergence to Nash Equilibrium (NE) in normal-form games and extensive-form
  games, through algorithms such as online double oracle (ODO) and extensive-form
  double oracle (XDO), respectively. In this study, we further examine the theoretical
  convergence rate and sample complexity of such regret minimization-based double
  oracle methods, utilizing a unified framework called Regret-Minimizing Double Oracle.
  Based on this framework, we extend ODO to extensive-form games and determine its
  sample complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of XDO can
  be exponential in the number of information sets $|S|$, owing to the exponentially
  decaying stopping threshold of restricted games. To solve this problem, we propose
  the Periodic Double Oracle (PDO) method, which has the lowest sample complexity
  among regret minimization-based double oracle methods, being only polynomial in
  $|S|$. Empirical evaluations on multiple poker and board games show that PDO achieves
  significantly faster convergence than previous double oracle algorithms and reaches
  a competitive level with state-of-the-art regret minimization methods.
