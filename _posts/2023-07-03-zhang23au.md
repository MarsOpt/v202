title: Do You Remember? Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting for Fake Audio Detection
openreview: GSqoaNo7Qg
abstract: Current fake audio detection algorithms have achieved promising performances
  on most datasets. However, their performance may be significantly degraded when
  dealing with audio of a different dataset. The orthogonal weight modification to
  overcome catastrophic forgetting does not consider the similarity of genuine audio
  across different datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a continual learning
  algorithm for fake audio detection to overcome catastrophic forgetting, called Regularized
  Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM). When fine-tuning a detection network, our approach
  adaptively computes the direction of weight modification according to the ratio
  of genuine utterances and fake utterances. The adaptive modification direction ensures
  the network can effectively detect fake audio on the new dataset while preserving
  its knowledge of old model, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In addition,
  genuine audio collected from quite different acoustic conditions may skew their
  feature distribution, so we introduce a regularization constraint to force the network
  to remember the old distribution in this regard. Our method can easily be generalized
  to related fields, like speech emotion recognition. We also evaluate our approach
  across multiple datasets and obtain a significant performance improvement on cross-dataset
  experiments.
