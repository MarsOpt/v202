title: The Benefits of Model-Based Generalization in Reinforcement Learning
openreview: Vue1ulwlPD
abstract: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely believed to have the potential
  to improve sample efficiency by allowing an agent to synthesize large amounts of
  imagined experience. Experience Replay (ER) can be considered a simple kind of model,
  which has proved effective at improving the stability and efficiency of deep RL.
  In principle, a learned parametric model could improve on ER by generalizing from
  real experience to augment the dataset with additional plausible experience. However,
  given that learned value functions can also generalize, it is not immediately obvious
  why model generalization should be better. Here, we provide theoretical and empirical
  insight into when, and how, we can expect data generated by a learned model to be
  useful. First, we provide a simple theorem motivating how learning a model as an
  intermediate step can narrow down the set of possible value functions more than
  learning a value function directly from data using the Bellman equation. Second,
  we provide an illustrative example showing empirically how a similar effect occurs
  in a more concrete setting with neural network function approximation. Finally,
  we provide extensive experiments showing the benefit of model-based learning for
  online RL in environments with combinatorial complexity, but factored structure
  that allows a learned model to generalize. In these experiments, we take care to
  control for other factors in order to isolate, insofar as possible, the benefit
  of using experience generated by a learned model relative to ER alone.
