title: Network Effects in Performative Prediction Games
openreview: vO12TSO55f
abstract: This paper studies the multi-agent performative prediction (Multi-PP) games
  over multiplex networks. We consider a distributed learning setting where agents
  partially cooperate on an agent network, while during learning, the data samples
  drawn depend on the prediction models of the agent itself and neighboring agents
  on a population network. The dynamics of Multi-PP games is hence affected by the
  interplay between both networks. This paper concentrates on this Multi-PP game with
  the following contributions. Firstly, we analyze sufficient conditions for the existence
  of the performative stable equilibrium (PSE) and Nash equilibrium (NE) of the Multi-PP
  games. Secondly, we analyze the changes to the equilibrium induced by perturbed
  data distributions, and derive the closed-form solutions where the network topologies
  are explicit. Our results connect the existence of PSE/NE with strengths of agentsâ€™
  cooperation, and the changes of equilibrium solutions across agents with their node
  centrality, etc. Lastly, we show that a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based
  distributed learning procedure finds the PSE under the said sufficient condition.
  Numerical illustrations on the network effects in Multi-PP games corroborate our
  findings.
