title: 'Neural Network Approximations of PDEs Beyond Linearity: A Representational
  Perspective'
openreview: nEsNOPLpgb
abstract: A burgeoning line of research has developed deep neural networks capable
  of approximating the solutions to high dimensional PDEs, opening related lines of
  theoretical inquiry focused on explaining how it is that these models appear to
  evade the curse of dimensionality. However, most theoretical analyses thus far have
  been limited to linear PDEs. In this work, we take a step towards studying the representational
  power of neural networks for approximating solutions to nonlinear PDEs. We focus
  on a class of PDEs known as <em>nonlinear elliptic variational PDEs</em>, whose
  solutions minimize an <em>Euler-Lagrange</em> energy functional $\mathcal{E}(u)
  = \int_\Omega L(x, u(x), \nabla u(x)) - f(x) u(x)dx$. We show that if composing
  a function with Barron norm $b$ with partial derivatives of $L$ produces a function
  of Barron norm at most $B_L b^p$, the solution to the PDE can be $\epsilon$-approximated
  in the $L^2$ sense by a function with Barron norm $O\left(\left(dB_L\right)^{\max\{p
  \log(1/ \epsilon), p^{\log(1/\epsilon)}\}}\right)$. By a classical result due to
  Barron (1993), this correspondingly bounds the size of a 2-layer neural network
  needed to approximate the solution. Treating $p, \epsilon, B_L$ as constants, this
  quantity is polynomial in dimension, thus showing neural networks can evade the
  curse of dimensionality. Our proof technique involves neurally simulating (preconditioned)
  gradient in an appropriate Hilbert space, which converges exponentially fast to
  the solution of the PDE, and such that we can bound the increase of the Barron norm
  at each iterate. Our results subsume and substantially generalize analogous prior
  results for linear elliptic PDEs over a unit hypercube.
