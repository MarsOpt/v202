title: Spherical Inducing Features for Orthogonally-Decoupled Gaussian Processes
openreview: s58a6Pxw7V
abstract: Despite their many desirable properties, Gaussian processes (GPs) are often
  compared unfavorably to deep neural networks (NNs) for lacking the ability to learn
  representations. Recent efforts to bridge the gap between GPs and deep NNs have
  yielded a new class of inter-domain variational GPs in which the inducing variables
  correspond to hidden units of a feedforward NN. In this work, we examine some practical
  issues associated with this approach and propose an extension that leverages the
  orthogonal decomposition of GPs to mitigate these limitations. In particular, we
  introduce spherical inter-domain features to construct more flexible data-dependent
  basis functions for both the principal and orthogonal components of the GP approximation
  and show that incorporating NN activation features under this framework not only
  alleviates these shortcomings but is more scalable than alternative strategies.
  Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach.
