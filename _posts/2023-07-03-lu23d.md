title: Contrastive Energy Prediction for Exact Energy-Guided Diffusion Sampling in
  Offline Reinforcement Learning
openreview: LucUrr5kUi
abstract: Guided sampling is a vital approach for applying diffusion models in real-world
  tasks that embeds human-defined guidance during the sampling procedure. This paper
  considers a general setting where the guidance is defined by an (unnormalized) energy
  function. The main challenge for this setting is that the intermediate guidance
  during the diffusion sampling procedure, which is jointly defined by the sampling
  distribution and the energy function, is unknown and is hard to estimate. To address
  this challenge, we propose an exact formulation of the intermediate guidance as
  well as a novel training objective named contrastive energy prediction (CEP) to
  learn the exact guidance. Our method is guaranteed to converge to the exact guidance
  under unlimited model capacity and data samples, while previous methods can not.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to offline reinforcement
  learning (RL). Extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method
  outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms. We also provide some examples
  of applying CEP for image synthesis to demonstrate the scalability of CEP on high-dimensional
  data.
