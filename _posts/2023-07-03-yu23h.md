title: 'SeedGNN: Graph Neural Network for Supervised Seeded Graph Matching'
openreview: sag7iLqPvC
abstract: 'There is a growing interest in designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for
  seeded graph matching, which aims to match two unlabeled graphs using only topological
  information and a small set of seed nodes. However, most previous GNNs for this
  task use a semi-supervised approach, which requires a large number of seeds and
  cannot learn knowledge that is transferable to unseen graphs. In contrast, this
  paper proposes a new supervised approach that can learn from a training set how
  to match unseen graphs with only a few seeds. Our SeedGNN architecture incorporates
  several novel designs, inspired by theoretical studies of seeded graph matching:
  1) it can learn to compute and use witness-like information from different hops,
  in a way that can be generalized to graphs of different sizes; 2) it can use easily-matched
  node-pairs as new seeds to improve the matching in subsequent layers. We evaluate
  SeedGNN on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate significant performance
  improvements over both non-learning and learning algorithms in the existing literature.
  Furthermore, our experiments confirm that the knowledge learned by SeedGNN from
  training graphs can be generalized to test graphs of different sizes and categories.'
