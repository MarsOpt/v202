title: Optimal Online Generalized Linear Regression with Stochastic Noise and Its
  Application to Heteroscedastic Bandits
openreview: p6h6jZb5jr
abstract: We study the problem of online generalized linear regression in the stochastic
  setting, where the label is generated from a generalized linear model with possibly
  unbounded additive noise. We provide a sharp analysis of the classical <em>follow-the-regularized-leader</em>
  (FTRL) algorithm to cope with the label noise. More specifically, for $\sigma$-sub-Gaussian
  label noise, our analysis provides a regret upper bound of $O(\sigma^2 d \log T)
  + o(\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the input vector, $T$ is the total number
  of rounds. We also prove an $\Omega(\sigma^2d\log(T/d))$ lower bound for stochastic
  online linear regression, which indicates that our upper bound is nearly optimal.
  In addition, we extend our analysis to a more refined Bernstein noise condition.
  As an application, we study generalized linear bandits with heterogeneous noise
  and propose an algorithm based on FTRL to achieve the first variance-aware regret
  bound.
