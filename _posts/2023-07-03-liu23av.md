title: Active Policy Improvement from Multiple Black-box Oracles
openreview: HAtMGUv1ci
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in various complex
  domains. However, identifying an effective policy via RL often necessitates extensive
  exploration. Imitation learning aims to mitigate this issue by using expert demonstrations
  to guide exploration. In real-world scenarios, one often has access to multiple
  suboptimal black-box experts, rather than a single optimal oracle. These experts
  do not universally outperform each other across all states, presenting a challenge
  in actively deciding which oracle to use and in which state. We introduce MAPS and
  MAPS-SE, a class of policy improvement algorithms that perform imitation learning
  from multiple suboptimal oracles. In particular, MAPS actively selects which of
  the oracles to imitate and improve their value function estimates, and MAPS-SE additionally
  leverages an active state exploration criterion to determine which states one should
  explore. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis and demonstrate that MAPS
  and MAPS-SE enjoy sample efficiency advantage over the state-of-the-art policy improvement
  algorithms. Empirical results show that MAPS-SE significantly accelerates policy
  optimization via state-wise imitation learning from multiple oracles across a broad
  spectrum of control tasks in the DeepMind Control Suite.
