title: Variational Sparse Inverse Cholesky Approximation for Latent Gaussian Processes
  via Double Kullback-Leibler Minimization
openreview: cg8EDdcIte
abstract: To achieve scalable and accurate inference for latent Gaussian processes,
  we propose a variational approximation based on a family of Gaussian distributions
  whose covariance matrices have sparse inverse Cholesky (SIC) factors. We combine
  this variational approximation of the posterior with a similar and efficient SIC-restricted
  Kullback-Leibler-optimal approximation of the prior. We then focus on a particular
  SIC ordering and nearest-neighbor-based sparsity pattern resulting in highly accurate
  prior and posterior approximations. For this setting, our variational approximation
  can be computed via stochastic gradient descent in polylogarithmic time per iteration.
  We provide numerical comparisons showing that the proposed double-Kullback-Leibler-optimal
  Gaussian-process approximation (DKLGP) can sometimes be vastly more accurate for
  stationary kernels than alternative approaches such as inducing-point and mean-field
  approximations at similar computational complexity.
