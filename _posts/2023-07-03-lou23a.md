title: Reflected Diffusion Models
openreview: QcKoLuEO3r
abstract: 'Score-based diffusion models learn to reverse a stochastic differential
  equation that maps data to noise. However, for complex tasks, numerical error can
  compound and result in highly unnatural samples. Previous work mitigates this drift
  with thresholding, which projects to the natural data domain (such as pixel space
  for images) after each diffusion step, but this leads to a mismatch between the
  training and generative processes. To incorporate data constraints in a principled
  manner, we present Reflected Diffusion Models, which instead reverse a reflected
  stochastic differential equation evolving on the support of the data. Our approach
  learns the perturbed score function through a generalized score matching loss and
  extends key components of standard diffusion models including diffusion guidance,
  likelihood-based training, and ODE sampling. We also bridge the theoretical gap
  with thresholding: such schemes are just discretizations of reflected SDEs. On standard
  image benchmarks, our method is competitive with or surpasses the state of the art
  without architectural modifications and, for classifier-free guidance, our approach
  enables fast exact sampling with ODEs and produces more faithful samples under high
  guidance weight.'
