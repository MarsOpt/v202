title: Model Transferability with Responsive Decision Subjects
openreview: IGfmSM7siu
abstract: Given an algorithmic predictor that is accurate on some source population
  consisting of strategic human decision subjects, will it remain accurate if the
  population respond to it? In our setting, an agent or a user corresponds to a sample
  $(X,Y)$ drawn from a distribution $\cal{D}$ and will face a model $h$ and its classification
  result $h(X)$. Agents can modify $X$ to adapt to $h$, which will incur a distribution
  shift on $(X,Y)$. Our formulation is motivated by applications where the deployed
  machine learning models are subjected to human agents, and will ultimately face
  responsive and interactive data distributions. We formalize the discussions of the
  transferability of a model by studying how the performance of the model trained
  on the available source distribution (data) would translate to the performance on
  its induced domain. We provide both upper bounds for the performance gap due to
  the induced domain shift, as well as lower bounds for the trade-offs that a classifier
  has to suffer on either the source training distribution or the induced target distribution.
  We provide further instantiated analysis for two popular domain adaptation settings,
  including covariate shift and target shift.
