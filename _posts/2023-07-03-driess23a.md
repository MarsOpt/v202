title: 'PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model'
openreview: VTpHpqM3Cf
abstract: 'Large language models excel at a wide range of complex tasks. However,
  enabling general inference in the real world, e.g. for robotics problems, raises
  the challenge of grounding. We propose embodied language models to directly incorporate
  real-world continuous sensor modalities into language models and thereby establish
  the link between words and percepts. Input to our embodied language model are multimodal
  sentences that interleave visual, continuous state estimation, and textual input
  encodings. We train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-trained
  large language model, for multiple embodied tasks including sequential robotic manipulation
  planning, visual question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show that PaLM-E,
  a single large embodied multimodal model, can address a variety of embodied reasoning
  tasks, from a variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments, and further,
  exhibits positive transfer: the model benefits from diverse joint training across
  internet-scale language, vision, and visual-language domains. Our largest model
  with 562B parameters, in addition to being trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language
  generalist with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains generalist language
  capabilities with increasing scale.'
