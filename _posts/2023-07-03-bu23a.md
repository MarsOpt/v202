title: Differentially Private Optimization on Large Model at Small Cost
openreview: 31CAQtoT3w
abstract: 'Differentially private (DP) optimization is the standard paradigm to learn
  large neural networks that are accurate and privacy-preserving. The computational
  cost for DP deep learning, however, is notoriously heavy due to the per-sample gradient
  clipping. Existing DP implementations are 2$\sim$1000$\times$ more costly in time
  and space complexity than the standard (non-private) training. In this work, we
  develop a novel Book-Keeping (BK) technique that implements existing DP optimizers
  (thus achieving the same accuracy), with a substantial improvement on the computational
  cost. Specifically, BK enables DP training on large models and high dimensional
  data to be roughly as fast and memory-saving as the standard training, whereas previous
  DP algorithms can be inefficient or incapable of training due to memory error. The
  computational advantage of BK is supported by the complexity analysis as well as
  extensive experiments on vision and language tasks. Our implementation achieves
  state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy with very small extra cost: on GPT2 and at almost
  the same memory cost ($<$1% overhead), BK has 1.03$\times$ the time complexity of
  the standard training (0.83$\times$ training speed in practice), and 0.61$\times$
  the time complexity of the most efficient DP implementation (1.36$\times$ training
  speed in practice). We open-source the codebase for the BK algorithm at https://github.com/awslabs/fast-differential-privacy.'
