title: Convex Geometry of ReLU-layers, Injectivity on the Ball and Local Reconstruction
openreview: ExwHyYdsmT
abstract: The paper uses a frame-theoretic setting to study the injectivity of a ReLU-layer
  on the closed ball of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and its non-negative part. In particular, the
  interplay between the radius of the ball and the bias vector is emphasized. Together
  with a perspective from convex geometry, this leads to a computationally feasible
  method of verifying the injectivity of a ReLU-layer under reasonable restrictions
  in terms of an upper bound of the bias vector. Explicit reconstruction formulas
  are provided, inspired by the duality concept from frame theory. All this gives
  rise to the possibility of quantifying the invertibility of a ReLU-layer and a concrete
  reconstruction algorithm for any input vector on the ball.
