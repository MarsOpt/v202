title: 'GAT: Guided Adversarial Training with Pareto-optimal Auxiliary Tasks'
openreview: 320btOVW8R
abstract: 'While leveraging additional training data is well established to improve
  adversarial robustness, it incurs the unavoidable cost of data collection and the
  heavy computation to train models. To mitigate the costs, we propose *Guided Adversarial
  Training * (GAT), a novel adversarial training technique that exploits auxiliary
  tasks under a limited set of training data. Our approach extends single-task models
  into multi-task models during the min-max optimization of adversarial training,
  and drives the loss optimization with a regularization of the gradient curvature
  across multiple tasks. GAT leverages two types of auxiliary tasks: self-supervised
  tasks, where the labels are generated automatically, and domain-knowledge tasks,
  where human experts provide additional labels. Experimentally, under limited data,
  GAT increases the robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 up to four times (from 11% to 42%
  robust accuracy) and the robust AUC of CheXpert medical imaging dataset from 50%
  to 83%. On the full CIFAR-10 dataset, GAT outperforms eight state-of-the-art adversarial
  training strategies. Our large study across five datasets and six tasks demonstrates
  that task augmentation is an efficient alternative to data augmentation, and can
  be key to achieving both clean and robust performances.'
