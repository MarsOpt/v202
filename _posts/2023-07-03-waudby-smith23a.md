title: Nonparametric Extensions of Randomized Response for Private Confidence Sets
openreview: gKxXNAVZeF
abstract: This work derives methods for performing nonparametric, nonasymptotic statistical
  inference for population means under the constraint of local differential privacy
  (LDP). Given bounded observations $(X_1, …, X_n)$ with mean $\mu^\star$ that are
  privatized into $(Z_1, …, Z_n)$, we present confidence intervals (CI) and time-uniform
  confidence sequences (CS) for $\mu^\star$ when only given access to the privatized
  data. To achieve this, we introduce a nonparametric and sequentially interactive
  generalization of Warner’s famous “randomized response” mechanism, satisfying LDP
  for arbitrary bounded random variables, and then provide CIs and CSs for their means
  given access to the resulting privatized observations. For example, our results
  yield private analogues of Hoeffding’s inequality in both fixed-time and time-uniform
  regimes. We extend these Hoeffding-type CSs to capture time-varying (non-stationary)
  means, and conclude by illustrating how these methods can be used to conduct private
  online A/B tests.
