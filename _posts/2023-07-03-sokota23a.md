title: Abstracting Imperfect Information Away from Two-Player Zero-Sum Games
openreview: bpGXNJ3kkU
abstract: In their seminal work, Nayyar et al. (2013) showed that imperfect information
  can be abstracted away from common-payoff games by having players publicly announce
  their policies as they play. This insight underpins sound solvers and decision-time
  planning algorithms for common-payoff games. Unfortunately, a naive application
  of the same insight to two-player zero-sum games fails because Nash equilibria of
  the game with public policy announcements may not correspond to Nash equilibria
  of the original game. As a consequence, existing sound decision-time planning algorithms
  require complicated additional mechanisms that have unappealing properties. The
  main contribution of this work is showing that certain regularized equilibria do
  not possess the aforementioned non-correspondence problem—thus, computing them can
  be treated as perfect-information problems. Because these regularized equilibria
  can be made arbitrarily close to Nash equilibria, our result opens the door to a
  new perspective to solving two-player zero-sum games and yields a simplified framework
  for decision-time planning in two-player zero-sum games, void of the unappealing
  properties that plague existing decision-time planning approaches.
