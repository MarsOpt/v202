title: 'PFGM++: Unlocking the Potential of Physics-Inspired Generative Models'
openreview: wmgyO9RZhy
abstract: We introduce a new family of physics-inspired generative models termed PFGM++
  that unifies diffusion models and Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM). These models
  realize generative trajectories for N dimensional data by embedding paths in N+D
  dimensional space while still controlling the progression with a simple scalar norm
  of the D additional variables. The new models reduce to PFGM when D=1 and to diffusion
  models when D$\to\infty$. The flexibility of choosing D allows us to trade off robustness
  against rigidity as increasing D results in more concentrated coupling between the
  data and the additional variable norms. We dispense with the biased large batch
  field targets used in PFGM and instead provide an unbiased perturbation-based objective
  similar to diffusion models. To explore different choices of D, we provide a direct
  alignment method for transferring well-tuned hyperparameters from diffusion models
  (D$\to\infty$) to any finite D values. Our experiments show that models with finite
  D can be superior to previous state-of-the-art diffusion models on CIFAR-10/FFHQ
  64$\times$64 datasets/LSUN Churches 256$\times$256, with median Ds. In class-conditional
  setting, D=2048 yields current state-of-the-art FID of 1.74 on CIFAR-10 without
  additional training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models with smaller $D$ exhibit
  improved robustness against modeling errors. Code is available at https://github.com/Newbeeer/pfgmpp
