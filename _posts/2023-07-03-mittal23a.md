title: Diffusion Based Representation Learning
openreview: LCAjuPNJP0
abstract: Diffusion-based methods, represented as stochastic differential equations
  on a continuous-time domain, have recently proven successful as non-adversarial
  generative models. Training such models relies on denoising score matching, which
  can be seen as multi-scale denoising autoencoders. Here, we augment the denoising
  score matching framework to enable representation learning without any supervised
  signal. GANs and VAEs learn representations by directly transforming latent codes
  to data samples. In contrast, the introduced diffusion-based representation learning
  relies on a new formulation of the denoising score matching objective and thus encodes
  the information needed for denoising. We illustrate how this difference allows for
  manual control of the level of details encoded in the representation. Using the
  same approach, we propose to learn an infinite-dimensional latent code that achieves
  improvements on state-of-the-art models on semi-supervised image classification.
  We also compare the quality of learned representations of diffusion score matching
  with other methods like autoencoder and contrastively trained systems through their
  performances on downstream tasks. Finally, we also ablate with a different SDE formulation
  for diffusion models and show that the benefits on downstream tasks are still present
  on changing the underlying differential equation.
