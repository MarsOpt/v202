title: 'Monge, Bregman and Occam: Interpretable Optimal Transport in High-Dimensions
  with Feature-Sparse Maps'
openreview: KnvZKvOaJ7
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) theory focuses, among all maps $T:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^d$ that can morph a probability measure $\mu$ onto another $\nu$, on
  those that are the “thriftiest”, i.e. such that the average cost $c(x, T(x))$ between
  $x$ and its image $T(x)$ is as small as possible. Many computational approaches
  have been proposed to estimate such <em>Monge</em> maps when $c$ is the squared-Euclidean
  distance, e.g., using entropic maps [Pooladian+2021], or input convex neural networks
  [Makkuva+2020, Korotin+2020]. We propose a new research direction, that leverages
  a specific translation invariant cost $c(x, y):=h(x-y)$ inspired by the elastic
  net. Here, $h:=\tfrac{1}{2}\|\cdot\|_2^2+\tau(\cdot)$, where $\tau$ is a convex
  function. We highlight a surprising link tying together a generalized entropic map
  for $h$, <em>Bregman</em> centroids induced by $h$, and the proximal operator of
  $\tau$. We show how setting $\tau$ to be a sparsity-inducing norm results in the
  first application of <em>Occam</em>’s razor to transport. These maps yield, mechanically,
  displacement vectors $\Delta(x):= T(x)-x$ that are sparse, with sparsity patterns
  that vary depending on $x$. We showcase the ability of our method to estimate meaningful
  OT maps for high-dimensional single-cell transcription data. We use our methods
  in the $34000$-d space of gene counts for cells, <em>without</em> using a prior
  dimensionality reduction, thus retaining the ability to interpret all displacements
  at the gene level.
