title: 'Lookahead When It Matters: Adaptive Non-causal Transformers for Streaming
  Neural Transducers'
openreview: NHfj50Wiry
abstract: 'Streaming speech recognition architectures are employed for low-latency,
  real-time applications. Such architectures are often characterized by their causality.
  Causal architectures emit tokens at each frame, relying only on current and past
  signal, while non-causal models are exposed to a window of future frames at each
  step to increase predictive accuracy. This dichotomy amounts to a trade-off for
  real-time Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system design: profit from the low-latency
  benefit of strictly-causal architectures while accepting predictive performance
  limitations, or realize the modeling benefits of future-context models accompanied
  by their higher latency penalty. In this work, we relax the constraints of this
  choice and present the Adaptive Non-Causal Attention Transducer (ANCAT). Our architecture
  is non-causal in the traditional sense, but executes in a low-latency, streaming
  manner by dynamically choosing when to rely on future context and to what degree
  within the audio stream. The resulting mechanism, when coupled with our novel regularization
  algorithms, delivers comparable accuracy to non-causal configurations while improving
  significantly upon latency, closing the gap with their causal counterparts. We showcase
  our design experimentally by reporting comparative ASR task results with measures
  of accuracy and latency on both publicly accessible and production-scale, voice-assistant
  datasets.'
