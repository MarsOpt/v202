title: Probabilistic Concept Bottleneck Models
openreview: yOxy3T0d6e
abstract: Interpretable models are designed to make decisions in a human-interpretable
  manner. Representatively, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) follow a two-step process
  of concept prediction and class prediction based on the predicted concepts. CBM
  provides explanations with high-level concepts derived from concept predictions;
  thus, reliable concept predictions are important for trustworthiness. In this study,
  we address the ambiguity issue that can harm reliability. While the existence of
  a concept can often be ambiguous in the data, CBM predicts concepts deterministically
  without considering this ambiguity. To provide a reliable interpretation against
  this ambiguity, we propose Probabilistic Concept Bottleneck Models (ProbCBM). By
  leveraging probabilistic concept embeddings, ProbCBM models uncertainty in concept
  prediction and provides explanations based on the concept and its corresponding
  uncertainty. This uncertainty enhances the reliability of the explanations. Furthermore,
  as class uncertainty is derived from concept uncertainty in ProbCBM, we can explain
  class uncertainty by means of concept uncertainty. Code is publicly available at
