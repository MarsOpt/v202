title: Bayes-optimal Learning of Deep Random Networks of Extensive-width
openreview: CXkJh2ITml
abstract: We consider the problem of learning a target function corresponding to a
  deep, extensive-width, non-linear neural network with random Gaussian weights. We
  consider the asymptotic limit where the number of samples, the input dimension and
  the network width are proportionally large and propose a closed-form expression
  for the Bayes-optimal test error, for regression and classification tasks. We further
  compute closed-form expressions for the test errors of ridge regression, kernel
  and random features regression. We find, in particular, that optimally regularized
  ridge regression, as well as kernel regression, achieve Bayes-optimal performances,
  while the logistic loss yields a near-optimal test error for classification. We
  further show numerically that when the number of samples grows faster than the dimension,
  ridge and kernel methods become suboptimal, while neural networks achieve test error
  close to zero from quadratically many samples.
