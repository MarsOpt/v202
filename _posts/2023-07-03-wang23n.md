title: 'FedHPO-Bench: A Benchmark Suite for Federated Hyperparameter Optimization'
openreview: 891ytYlYgB
abstract: Research in the field of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been greatly
  accelerated by existing HPO benchmarks. Nonetheless, existing efforts in benchmarking
  all focus on HPO for traditional learning paradigms while ignoring federated learning
  (FL), a promising paradigm for collaboratively learning models from dispersed data.
  In this paper, we first identify some uniqueness of federated hyperparameter optimization
  (FedHPO) from various aspects, showing that existing HPO benchmarks no longer satisfy
  the need to study FedHPO methods. To facilitate the research of FedHPO, we propose
  and implement a benchmark suite FedHPO-Bench that incorporates comprehensive FedHPO
  problems, enables flexible customization of the function evaluations, and eases
  continuing extensions. We conduct extensive experiments based on FedHPO-Bench to
  provide the community with more insights into FedHPO. We open-sourced FedHPO-Bench
  at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope/tree/master/benchmark/FedHPOBench.
