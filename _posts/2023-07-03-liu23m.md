title: Constrained Decision Transformer for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning
openreview: 9VKCBHESq0
abstract: 'Safe reinforcement learning (RL) trains a constraint satisfaction policy
  by interacting with the environment. We aim to tackle a more challenging problem:
  learning a safe policy from an offline dataset. We study the offline safe RL problem
  from a novel multi-objective optimization perspective and propose the $\epsilon$-reducible
  concept to characterize problem difficulties. The inherent trade-offs between safety
  and task performance inspire us to propose the constrained decision transformer
  (CDT) approach, which can dynamically adjust the trade-offs during deployment. Extensive
  experiments show the advantages of the proposed method in learning an adaptive,
  safe, robust, and high-reward policy. CDT outperforms its variants and strong offline
  safe RL baselines by a large margin with the same hyperparameters across all tasks,
  while keeping the zero-shot adaptation capability to different constraint thresholds,
  making our approach more suitable for real-world RL under constraints.'
