title: Loss Balancing for Fair Supervised Learning
openreview: gVGZyRDpXX
abstract: Supervised learning models have been used in various domains such as lending,
  college admission, face recognition, natural language processing, etc. However,
  they may inherit pre-existing biases from training data and exhibit discrimination
  against protected social groups. Various fairness notions have been proposed to
  address unfairness issues. In this work, we focus on Equalized Loss (EL), a fairness
  notion that requires the expected loss to be (approximately) equalized across different
  groups. Imposing EL on the learning process leads to a non-convex optimization problem
  even if the loss function is convex, and the existing fair learning algorithms cannot
  properly be adopted to find the fair predictor under the EL constraint. This paper
  introduces an algorithm that can leverage off-the-shelf convex programming tools
  (e.g., CVXPY (Diamond and Boyd, 2016; Agrawal et al., 2018)) to efficiently find
  the global optimum of this non-convex optimization. In particular, we propose the
  ELminimizer algorithm, which finds the optimal fair predictor under EL by reducing
  the non-convex optimization to a sequence of convex optimization problems. We theoretically
  prove that our algorithm finds the global optimal solution under certain conditions.
  Then, we support our theoretical results through several empirical studies
