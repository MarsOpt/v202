title: Auxiliary Learning as an Asymmetric Bargaining Game
openreview: MWzQgOtaFi
abstract: 'Auxiliary learning is an effective method for enhancing the generalization
  capabilities of trained models, particularly when dealing with small datasets. However,
  this approach may present several difficulties: (i) optimizing multiple objectives
  can be more challenging, and (ii) how to balance the auxiliary tasks to best assist
  the main task is unclear. In this work, we propose a novel approach, named AuxiNash,
  for balancing tasks in auxiliary learning by formalizing the problem as generalized
  bargaining game with asymmetric task bargaining power. Furthermore, we describe
  an efficient procedure for learning the bargaining power of tasks based on their
  contribution to the performance of the main task and derive theoretical guarantees
  for its convergence. Finally, we evaluate AuxiNash on multiple multi-task benchmarks
  and find that it consistently outperforms competing methods.'
