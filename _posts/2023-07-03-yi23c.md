title: 'MonoFlow: Rethinking Divergence GANs via the Perspective of Wasserstein Gradient
  Flows'
openreview: hV4quLiR4c
abstract: 'The conventional understanding of adversarial training in generative adversarial
  networks (GANs) is that the discriminator is trained to estimate a divergence, and
  the generator learns to minimize this divergence. We argue that despite the fact
  that many variants of GANs were developed following this paradigm, the current theoretical
  understanding of GANs and their practical algorithms are inconsistent. In this paper,
  we leverage Wasserstein gradient flows which characterize the evolution of particles
  in the sample space, to gain theoretical insights and algorithmic inspiration of
  GANs. We introduce a unified generative modeling framework – MonoFlow: the particle
  evolution is rescaled via a monotonically increasing mapping of the log density
  ratio. Under our framework, adversarial training can be viewed as a procedure first
  obtaining MonoFlow’s vector field via training the discriminator and the generator
  learns to draw the particle flow defined by the corresponding vector field. We also
  reveal the fundamental difference between variational divergence minimization and
  adversarial training. This analysis helps us to identify what types of generator
  loss functions can lead to the successful training of GANs and suggest that GANs
  may have more loss designs beyond the literature (e.g., non-saturated loss), as
  long as they realize MonoFlow. Consistent empirical studies are included to validate
  the effectiveness of our framework.'
