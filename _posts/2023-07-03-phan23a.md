title: Attention-Based Recurrence for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning under Stochastic
  Partial Observability
openreview: 23uOLxPd34
abstract: Stochastic partial observability poses a major challenge for decentralized
  coordination in multi-agent reinforcement learning but is largely neglected in state-of-the-art
  research due to a strong focus on state-based centralized training for decentralized
  execution (CTDE) and benchmarks that lack sufficient stochasticity like StarCraft
  Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). In this paper, we propose Attention-based Embeddings
  of Recurrence In multi-Agent Learning (AERIAL) to approximate value functions under
  stochastic partial observability. AERIAL replaces the true state with a learned
  representation of multi-agent recurrence, considering more accurate information
  about decentralized agent decisions than state-based CTDE. We then introduce MessySMAC,
  a modified version of SMAC with stochastic observations and higher variance in initial
  states, to provide a more general and configurable benchmark regarding stochastic
  partial observability. We evaluate AERIAL in Dec-Tiger as well as in a variety of
  SMAC and MessySMAC maps, and compare the results with state-based CTDE. Furthermore,
  we evaluate the robustness of AERIAL and state-based CTDE against various stochasticity
  configurations in MessySMAC.
