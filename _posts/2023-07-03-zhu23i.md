title: 'Interpolation for Robust Learning: Data Augmentation on Wasserstein Geodesics'
openreview: RjMB0hmru2
abstract: We propose to study and promote the robustness of a model as per its performance
  on a continuous geodesic interpolation of subpopulations, e.g., a class of samples
  in a classification problem. Specifically, (1) we augment the data by finding the
  worst-case Wasserstein barycenter on the geodesic connecting subpopulation distributions.
  (2) we regularize the model for smoother performance on the continuous geodesic
  path connecting subpopulation distributions. (3) Additionally, we provide a theoretical
  guarantee of robustness improvement and investigate how the geodesic location and
  the sample size contribute, respectively. Experimental validations of the proposed
  strategy on four datasets including CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, establish the efficacy
  of our method, e.g., our method improves the baselinesâ€™ certifiable robustness on
  CIFAR10 upto 7.7%, with 16.8% on empirical robustness on CIFAR-100. Our work provides
  a new perspective of model robustness through the lens of Wasserstein geodesic-based
  interpolation with a practical off-the-shelf strategy that can be combined with
  existing robust training methods.
