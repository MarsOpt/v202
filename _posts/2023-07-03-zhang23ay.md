title: 'OpenFE: Automated Feature Generation with Expert-level Performance'
openreview: 1H1irbEaGV
abstract: 'The goal of automated feature generation is to liberate machine learning
  experts from the laborious task of manual feature generation, which is crucial for
  improving the learning performance of tabular data. The major challenge in automated
  feature generation is to efficiently and accurately identify effective features
  from a vast pool of candidate features. In this paper, we present OpenFE, an automated
  feature generation tool that provides competitive results against machine learning
  experts. OpenFE achieves high efficiency and accuracy with two components: 1) a
  novel feature boosting method for accurately evaluating the incremental performance
  of candidate features and 2) a two-stage pruning algorithm that performs feature
  pruning in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets
  show that OpenFE outperforms existing baseline methods by a large margin. We further
  evaluate OpenFE in two Kaggle competitions with thousands of data science teams
  participating. In the two competitions, features generated by OpenFE with a simple
  baseline model can beat 99.3% and 99.6% data science teams respectively. In addition
  to the empirical results, we provide a theoretical perspective to show that feature
  generation can be beneficial in a simple yet representative setting.'
