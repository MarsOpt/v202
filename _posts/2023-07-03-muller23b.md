title: Achieving High Accuracy with PINNs via Energy Natural Gradient Descent
openreview: y6sCx3eJpw
abstract: We propose energy natural gradient descent, a natural gradient method with
  respect to a Hessian-induced Riemannian metric as an optimization algorithm for
  physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and the deep Ritz method. As a main motivation
  we show that the update direction in function space resulting from the energy natural
  gradient corresponds to the Newton direction modulo an orthogonal projection on
  the model’s tangent space. We demonstrate experimentally that energy natural gradient
  descent yields highly accurate solutions with errors several orders of magnitude
  smaller than what is obtained when training PINNs with standard optimizers like
  gradient descent or Adam, even when those are allowed significantly more computation
  time.
