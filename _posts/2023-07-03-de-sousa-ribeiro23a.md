title: High Fidelity Image Counterfactuals with Probabilistic Causal Models
openreview: DA0PROpwan
abstract: We present a general causal generative modelling framework for accurate
  estimation of high fidelity image counterfactuals with deep structural causal models.
  Estimation of interventional and counterfactual queries for high-dimensional structured
  variables, such as images, remains a challenging task. We leverage ideas from causal
  mediation analysis and advances in generative modelling to design new deep causal
  mechanisms for structured variables in causal models. Our experiments demonstrate
  that our proposed mechanisms are capable of accurate abduction and estimation of
  direct, indirect and total effects as measured by axiomatic soundness of counterfactuals.
