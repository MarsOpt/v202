title: 'MEWL: Few-shot multimodal word learning with referential uncertainty'
openreview: 7xKIFaeEBG
abstract: 'Without explicit feedback, humans can rapidly learn the meaning of words.
  Children can acquire a new word after just a few passive exposures, a process known
  as fast mapping. This word learning capability is believed to be the most fundamental
  building block of multimodal understanding and reasoning. Despite recent advancements
  in multimodal learning, a systematic and rigorous evaluation is still missing for
  human-like word learning in machines. To fill in this gap, we introduce the MachinE
  Word Learning (MEWL) benchmark to assess how machines learn word meaning in grounded
  visual scenes. MEWL covers human’s core cognitive toolkits in word learning: cross-situational
  reasoning, bootstrapping, and pragmatic learning. Specifically, MEWL is a few-shot
  benchmark suite consisting of nine tasks for probing various word learning capabilities.
  These tasks are carefully designed to be aligned with the children’s core abilities
  in word learning and echo the theories in the developmental literature. By evaluating
  multimodal and unimodal agents’ performance with a comparative analysis of human
  performance, we notice a sharp divergence in human and machine word learning. We
  further discuss these differences between humans and machines and call for human-like
  few-shot word learning in machines.'
