title: Temporally Consistent Transformers for Video Generation
openreview: MxpU5qQZSb
abstract: 'To generate accurate videos, algorithms have to understand the spatial
  and temporal dependencies in the world. Current algorithms enable accurate predictions
  over short horizons but tend to suffer from temporal inconsistencies. When generated
  content goes out of view and is later revisited, the model invents different content
  instead. Despite this severe limitation, no established benchmarks exist for video
  generation with long temporal dependencies. In this paper, we curate 3 challenging
  video datasets with long-range dependencies by rendering walks through 3D scenes
  of procedural mazes, Minecraft worlds, and indoor scans. We perform a comprehensive
  evaluation of current models and observe their limitations in temporal consistency.
  Moreover, we introduce the Temporally Consistent Transformer (TECO), a generative
  model that substantially improves long-term consistency while also reducing sampling
  time. By compressing its input sequence into fewer embeddings, applying a temporal
  transformer, and expanding back using a spatial MaskGit, TECO outperforms existing
  models across many metrics. Videos are available on the website: https://wilson1yan.github.io/teco'
