title: Understanding and Generalizing Contrastive Learning from the Inverse Optimal
  Transport Perspective
openreview: DBlWCsOy94
abstract: Previous research on contrastive learning (CL) has primarily focused on
  pairwise views to learn representations by attracting positive samples and repelling
  negative ones. In this work, we aim to understand and generalize CL from a point
  set matching perspective, instead of the comparison between two points. Specifically,
  we formulate CL as a form of inverse optimal transport (IOT), which involves a bilevel
  optimization procedure for learning where the outter minimization aims to learn
  the representations and the inner is to learn the coupling (i.e. the probability
  of matching matrix) between the point sets. Specifically, by adjusting the relaxation
  degree of constraints in the inner minimization, we obtain three contrastive losses
  and show that the dominant contrastive loss in literature InfoNCE falls into one
  of these losses. This reveals a new and more general algorithmic framework for CL.
  Additionally, the soft matching scheme in IOT induces a uniformity penalty to enhance
  representation learning which is akin to the CLâ€™s uniformity. Results on vision
  benchmarks show the effectiveness of our derived loss family and the new uniformity
  term.
