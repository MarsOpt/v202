title: Bayesian online change point detection with Hilbert space approximate Student-t
  process
openreview: 1e2xR04JVl
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a variant of Bayesian online change point detection
  with a reducedrank Student-t process (TP) and dependent Student-t noise, as a nonparametric
  time series model. Our method builds and improves upon the state-of-the-art Gaussian
  process (GP) change point model benchmark of Saatci et al. (2010). The Student-t
  process generalizes the concept of a GP and hence yields a more flexible alternative.
  Additionally, unlike a GP, the predictive variance explicitly depends on the training
  observations, while the use of an entangled Student-t noise model preserves analytical
  tractability. Our approach also uses a Hilbert space reduced-rank representation
  of the TP kernel, derived from an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator
  (Solin & Sarkka, 2020), to alleviate its computational complexity. Improvements
  in prediction and training time are demonstrated with real-world data-sets
