title: Faster Rates of Convergence to Stationary Points in Differentially Private
  Optimization
openreview: kOUBFwYd2D
abstract: We study the problem of approximating stationary points of Lipschitz and
  smooth functions under $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) in both
  the finite-sum and stochastic settings. A point $\widehat{w}$ is called an $\alpha$-stationary
  point of a function $F:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ if $\|\nabla F(\widehat{w})\|\leq
  \alpha$. We give a new construction that improves over the existing rates in the
  stochastic optimization setting, where the goal is to find approximate stationary
  points of the population risk given $n$ samples. Our construction finds a $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}}
  + \big[\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}\big]^{1/2}\big)$-stationary point of the population
  risk in time linear in $n$. We also provide an efficient algorithm that finds an
  $\tilde{O}\big(\big[\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}\big]^{2/3}\big)$-stationary point
  in the finite-sum setting. This improves on the previous best rate of $\tilde{O}\big(\big[\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}\big]^{1/2}\big)$.
  Furthermore, under the additional assumption of convexity, we completely characterize
  the sample complexity of finding stationary points of the population risk (up to
  polylog factors) and show that the optimal rate on population stationarity is $\tilde
  \Theta\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}\big)$. Finally, we show
  that our methods can be used to provide dimension-independent rates of $O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\min\big(\big[\frac{\sqrt{rank}}{n\varepsilon}\big]^{2/3},\frac{1}{(n\varepsilon)^{2/5}}\big)\big)$
  on population stationarity for Generalized Linear Models (GLM), where $rank$ is
  the rank of the design matrix, which improves upon the previous best known rate.
