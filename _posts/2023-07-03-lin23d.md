title: 'Text Generation with Diffusion Language Models: A Pre-training Approach with
  Continuous Paragraph Denoise'
openreview: oY8JcQzahW
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel dIffusion language modEl pre-training
  framework for text generation, which we call GENIE. GENIE is a large-scale pre-trained
  diffusion language model that consists of an encoder and a diffusion-based decoder,
  which can generate text by gradually transforming a random noise sequence into a
  coherent text sequence. To pre-train GENIE on a large-scale language corpus, we
  design a new continuous paragraph denoise objective, which encourages the diffusion-decoder
  to reconstruct a clean text paragraph from a corrupted version, while preserving
  the semantic and syntactic coherence. We evaluate GENIE on four downstream text
  generation benchmarks, namely XSum, CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, and CommonGen. Our
  experimental results show that GENIE achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art
  autoregressive models on these benchmarks, and generates more diverse text samples.
  The code and models of GENIE are available at https://github.com/microsoft/ProphetNet/tree/master/GENIE.
