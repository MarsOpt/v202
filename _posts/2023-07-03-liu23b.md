title: Shapley Based Residual Decomposition for Instance Analysis
openreview: WynSfmgRyZ
abstract: In this paper, we introduce the idea of decomposing the residuals of regression
  with respect to the data instances instead of features. This allows us to determine
  the effects of each individual instance on the model and each other, and in doing
  so makes for a model-agnostic method of identifying instances of interest. In doing
  so, we can also determine the appropriateness of the model and data in the wider
  context of a given study. The paper focuses on the possible applications that such
  a framework brings to the relatively unexplored field of instance analysis in the
  context of Explainable AI tasks.
