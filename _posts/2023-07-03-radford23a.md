title: Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision
openreview: Xr12kpEP3G
abstract: We study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to
  predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled to 680,000
  hours of multilingual and multitask supervision, the resulting models generalize
  well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised
  results without the need for any dataset specific fine-tuning. When compared to
  humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness. We are releasing models
  and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing.
