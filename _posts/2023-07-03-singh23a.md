title: The Hessian perspective into the Nature of Convolutional Neural Networks
openreview: BrOPvKsIXW
abstract: While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have long been investigated and
  applied, as well as theorized, we aim to provide a slightly different perspective
  into their nature — through the perspective of their Hessian maps. The reason is
  that the loss Hessian captures the pairwise interaction of parameters and therefore
  forms a natural ground to probe how the architectural aspects of CNNs get manifested
  in their structure and properties. We develop a framework relying on Toeplitz representation
  of CNNs, and then utilize it to reveal the Hessian structure and, in particular,
  its rank. We prove tight upper bounds (with linear activations), which closely follow
  the empirical trend of the Hessian rank and in practice also hold for more general
  settings. Overall, our work generalizes and further establishes the key insight
  that the Hessian rank grows as the square root of the number of parameters, even
  in CNNs.
