title: 'Semi Bandit dynamics in Congestion Games: Convergence to Nash Equilibrium
  and No-Regret Guarantees.'
openreview: Rw8OOwatgy
abstract: In this work, we propose introduce a variant of online stochastic gradient
  descent and prove it converges to Nash equilibria and simultaneously it has sublinear
  regret for the class of congestion games in the semi-bandit feedback setting. Our
  proposed method admits convergence rates depending only polynomially on the number
  of players and the number of facilities, but not on the size of the action set,
  which can be exponentially large in terms of the number of facilities. Moreover,
  the running time of our method has polynomial-time dependence on the implicit description
  of the game. Our analysis exploits techniques from convex geometry, in particular
  Caratheodoryâ€™s theorem and recent advances in non-convex stochastic optimization.
  This work improves upon and answers an open question from (Cui et al 2022).
