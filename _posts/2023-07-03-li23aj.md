title: 'SMURF-THP: Score Matching-based UnceRtainty quantiFication for Transformer
  Hawkes Process'
openreview: ZeEkuTENLH
abstract: Transformer Hawkes process models have shown to be successful in modeling
  event sequence data. However, most of the existing training methods rely on maximizing
  the likelihood of event sequences, which involves calculating some intractable integral.
  Moreover, the existing methods fail to provide uncertainty quantification for model
  predictions, e.g., confidence interval for the predicted event’s arrival time. To
  address these issues, we propose SMURF-THP, a score-based method for learning Transformer
  Hawkes process and quantifying prediction uncertainty. Specifically, SMURF-THP learns
  the score function of the event’s arrival time based on a score-matching objective
  that avoids the intractable computation. With such a learnt score function, we can
  sample arrival time of events from the predictive distribution. This naturally allows
  for the quantification of uncertainty by computing confidence intervals over the
  generated samples. We conduct extensive experiments in both event type prediction
  and uncertainty quantification on time of arrival. In all the experiments, SMURF-THP
  outperforms existing likelihood-based methods in confidence calibration while exhibiting
  comparable prediction accuracy.
