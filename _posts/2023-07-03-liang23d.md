title: 'Accuracy on the Curve: On the Nonlinear Correlation of ML Performance Between
  Data Subpopulations'
openreview: oRkZj3Bju2
abstract: Understanding the performance of machine learning (ML) models across diverse
  data distributions is critically important for reliable applications. Despite recent
  empirical studies positing a near-perfect linear correlation between in-distribution
  (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, we empirically demonstrate that this
  correlation is more nuanced under subpopulation shifts. Through rigorous experimentation
  and analysis across a variety of datasets, models, and training epochs, we demonstrate
  that OOD performance often has a nonlinear correlation with ID performance in subpopulation
  shifts. Our findings, which contrast previous studies that have posited a linear
  correlation in model performance during distribution shifts, reveal a "moon shape"
  correlation (parabolic uptrend curve) between the test performance on the majority
  subpopulation and the minority subpopulation. This non-trivial nonlinear correlation
  holds across model architectures, hyperparameters, training durations, and the imbalance
  between subpopulations. Furthermore, we found that the nonlinearity of this "moon
  shape" is causally influenced by the degree of spurious correlations in the training
  data. Our controlled experiments show that stronger spurious correlation in the
  training data creates more nonlinear performance correlation. We provide complementary
  experimental and theoretical analyses for this phenomenon, and discuss its implications
  for ML reliability and fairness. Our work highlights the importance of understanding
  the nonlinear effects of model improvement on performance in different subpopulations,
  and has the potential to inform the development of more equitable and responsible
  machine learning models.
