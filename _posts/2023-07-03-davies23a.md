title: Fast Combinatorial Algorithms for Min Max Correlation Clustering
openreview: OUjObDqOM2
abstract: We introduce fast algorithms for correlation clustering with respect to
  the Min Max objective that provide constant factor approximations on complete graphs.
  Our algorithms are the first purely combinatorial approximation algorithms for this
  problem. We construct a novel semi-metric on the set of vertices, which we call
  the correlation metric, that indicates to our clustering algorithms whether pairs
  of nodes should be in the same cluster. The paper demonstrates empirically that,
  compared to prior work, our algorithms sacrifice little in the objective quality
  to obtain significantly better run-time. Moreover, our algorithms scale to larger
  networks that are effectively intractable for known algorithms.
