title: Parallel Online Clustering of Bandits via Hedonic Game
openreview: pLky79p1Ne
abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms appear in several applications, such as online
  advertisement and recommendation systems like personalized education or personalized
  medicine. Individually-tailored recommendations boost the performance of the underlying
  application; nevertheless, providing individual suggestions becomes costly and even
  implausible as the number of users grows. As such, to efficiently serve the demands
  of several users in modern applications, it is imperative to identify the underlying
  usersâ€™ clusters, i.e., the groups of users for which a single recommendation might
  be (near-)optimal. We propose CLUB-HG, a novel algorithm that integrates a game-theoretic
  approach into clustering inference. Our algorithm achieves Nash equilibrium at each
  inference step and discovers the underlying clusters. We also provide regret analysis
  within a standard linear stochastic noise setting. Finally, experiments on synthetic
  and real-world datasets show the superior performance of our proposed algorithm
  compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.
