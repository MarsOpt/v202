title: Learning for Edge-Weighted Online Bipartite Matching with Robustness Guarantees
openreview: NHOpWtjjwh
abstract: Many problems, such as online ad display, can be formulated as online bipartite
  matching. The crucial challenge lies in the nature of sequentially-revealed online
  item information, based on which we make irreversible matching decisions at each
  step. While numerous expert online algorithms have been proposed with bounded worst-case
  competitive ratios, they may not offer satisfactory performance in average cases.
  On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to improve the average
  performance, but it lacks robustness and can perform arbitrarily poorly. In this
  paper, we propose a novel RL-based approach to edge-weighted online bipartite matching
  with robustness guarantees (LOMAR), achieving both good average-case and worst-case
  performance. The key novelty of LOMAR is a new online switching operation which,
  based on a judicious condition to hedge against future uncertainties, decides whether
  to follow the expertâ€™s decision or the RL decision for each online item. We prove
  that for any $\rho\in[0,1]$, LOMAR is $\rho$-competitive against any given expert
  online algorithm. To improve the average performance, we train the RL policy by
  explicitly considering the online switching operation. Finally, we run empirical
  experiments to demonstrate the advantages of LOMAR compared to existing baselines.
