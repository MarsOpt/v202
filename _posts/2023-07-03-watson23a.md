title: On Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Heterogeneous Causal Graphs
openreview: Lg6ia0e8fo
abstract: 'Heterogeneity and comorbidity are two interwoven challenges associated
  with various healthcare problems that greatly hampered research on developing effective
  treatment and understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanism. Very few
  studies have been conducted to investigate heterogeneous causal effects (HCEs) in
  graphical contexts due to the lack of statistical methods. To characterize this
  heterogeneity, we first conceptualize heterogeneous causal graphs (HCGs) by generalizing
  the causal graphical model with confounder-based interactions and multiple mediators.
  Such confounders with an interaction with the treatment are known as moderators.
  This allows us to flexibly produce HCGs given different moderators and explicitly
  characterize HCEs from the treatment or potential mediators on the outcome. We establish
  the theoretical forms of HCEs and derive their properties at the individual level
  in both linear and nonlinear models. An interactive structural learning is developed
  to estimate the complex HCGs and HCEs with confidence intervals provided. Our method
  is empirically justified by extensive simulations and its practical usefulness is
  illustrated by exploring causality among psychiatric disorders for trauma survivors.
  Code implementing the proposed algorithm is open-source and publicly available at:
