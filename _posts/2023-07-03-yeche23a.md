title: Temporal Label Smoothing for Early Event Prediction
openreview: zZyYTpB3S7
abstract: Models that can predict the occurrence of events ahead of time with low
  false-alarm rates are critical to the acceptance of decision support systems in
  the medical community. This challenging task is typically treated as a simple binary
  classification, ignoring temporal dependencies between samples, whereas we propose
  to exploit this structure. We first introduce a common theoretical framework unifying
  dynamic survival analysis and early event prediction. Following an analysis of objectives
  from both fields, we propose Temporal Label Smoothing (TLS), a simpler, yet best-performing
  method that preserves prediction monotonicity over time. By focusing the objective
  on areas with a stronger predictive signal, TLS improves performance over all baselines
  on two large-scale benchmark tasks. Gains are particularly notable along clinically
  relevant measures, such as event recall at low false-alarm rates. TLS reduces the
  number of missed events by up to a factor of two over previously used approaches
  in early event prediction.
