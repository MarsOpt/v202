title: 'SRATTA: Sample Re-ATTribution Attack of Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning.'
openreview: pRsJIVcjxD
abstract: We consider a federated learning (FL) setting where a machine learning model
  with a fully connected first layer is trained between different clients and a central
  server using FedAvg, and where the aggregation step can be performed with secure
  aggregation (SA). We present SRATTA an attack relying only on aggregated models
  which, under realistic assumptions, (i) recovers data samples from the different
  clients, and (ii) groups data samples coming from the same client together. While
  sample recovery has already been explored in an FL setting, the ability to group
  samples per client, despite the use of SA, is novel. This poses a significant unforeseen
  security threat to FL and effectively breaks SA. We show that SRATTA is both theoretically
  grounded and can be used in practice on realistic models and datasets. We also propose
  counter-measures, and claim that clients should play an active role to guarantee
  their privacy during training.
