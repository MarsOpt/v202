title: 'Mirror Sinkhorn: Fast Online Optimization on Transport Polytopes'
openreview: ImQC3p9wlm
abstract: Optimal transport is an important tool in machine learning, allowing to
  capture geometric properties of the data through a linear program on transport polytopes.
  We present a single-loop optimization algorithm for minimizing general convex objectives
  on these domains, utilizing the principles of Sinkhorn matrix scaling and mirror
  descent. The proposed algorithm is robust to noise, and can be used in an online
  setting. We provide theoretical guarantees for convex objectives and experimental
  results showcasing it effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world data.
