title: 'ODS: Test-Time Adaptation in the Presence of Open-World Data Shift'
openreview: Phjti0QbkZ
abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) adapts a source model to the distribution shift
  in testing data without using any source data. There have been plenty of algorithms
  concentrated on covariate shift in the last decade, i.e., $\mathcal{D}_t(X)$, the
  distribution of the test data is different from the source data. Nonetheless, in
  real application scenarios, it is necessary to consider the influence of label distribution
  shift, i.e., both $\mathcal{D}_t(X)$ and $\mathcal{D}_t(Y)$ are shifted, which has
  not been sufficiently explored yet. To remedy this, we study a new problem setup,
  namely, TTA with Open-world Data Shift (AODS). The goal of AODS is simultaneously
  adapting a model to covariate and label distribution shifts in the test phase. In
  this paper, we first analyze the relationship between classification error and distribution
  shifts. Motivated by this, we hence propose a new framework, namely ODS, which decouples
  the mixed distribution shift and then addresses covariate and label distribution
  shifts accordingly. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmarks with different
  types of shifts, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our method
  against the state of the arts. Moreover, ODS is suitable for many TTA algorithms.
