title: Provably Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning with Perturbed Data Sources
openreview: V5ULNu7Kix
abstract: Existing theoretical studies on offline reinforcement learning (RL) mostly
  consider a dataset sampled directly from the target task. In practice, however,
  data often come from several heterogeneous but related sources. Motivated by this
  gap, this work aims at rigorously understanding offline RL with multiple datasets
  that are collected from randomly perturbed versions of the target task instead of
  from itself. An information-theoretic lower bound is derived, which reveals a necessary
  requirement on the number of involved sources in addition to that on the number
  of data samples. Then, a novel HetPEVI algorithm is proposed, which simultaneously
  considers the sample uncertainties from a finite number of data samples per data
  source and the source uncertainties due to a finite number of available data sources.
  Theoretical analyses demonstrate that HetPEVI can solve the target task as long
  as the data sources collectively provide a good data coverage. Moreover, HetPEVI
  is demonstrated to be optimal up to a polynomial factor of the horizon length. Finally,
  the study is extended to offline Markov games and offline robust RL, which demonstrates
  the generality of the proposed designs and theoretical analyses.
