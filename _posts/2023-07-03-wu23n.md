title: Delay-agnostic Asynchronous Coordinate Update Algorithm
openreview: 2iNOg04g8R
abstract: We propose a delay-agnostic asynchronous coordinate update algorithm (DEGAS)
  for computing operator fixed points, with applications to asynchronous optimization.
  DEGAS includes novel asynchronous variants of ADMM and block-coordinate descent
  as special cases. We prove that DEGAS converges with both bounded and unbounded
  delays under delay-free parameter conditions. We also validate by theory and experiments
  that DEGAS adapts well to the actual delays. The effectiveness of DEGAS is demonstrated
  by numerical experiments on classification problems.
