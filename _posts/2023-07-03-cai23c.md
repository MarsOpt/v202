title: 'Ske2Grid: Skeleton-to-Grid Representation Learning for Action Recognition'
openreview: SQtp4uUByd
abstract: This paper presents Ske2Grid, a new representation learning framework for
  improved skeleton-based action recognition. In Ske2Grid, we define a regular convolution
  operation upon a novel grid representation of human skeleton, which is a compact
  image-like grid patch constructed and learned through three novel designs. Specifically,
  we propose a graph-node index transform (GIT) to construct a regular grid patch
  through assigning the nodes in the skeleton graph one by one to the desired grid
  cells. To ensure that GIT is a bijection and enrich the expressiveness of the grid
  representation, an up-sampling transform (UPT) is learned to interpolate the skeleton
  graph nodes for filling the grid patch to the full. To resolve the problem when
  the one-step UPT is aggressive and further exploit the representation capability
  of the grid patch with increasing spatial size, a progressive learning strategy
  (PLS) is proposed which decouples the UPT into multiple steps and aligns them to
  multiple paired GITs through a compact cascaded design learned progressively. We
  construct networks upon prevailing graph convolution networks and conduct experiments
  on six mainstream skeleton-based action recognition datasets. Experiments show that
  our Ske2Grid significantly outperforms existing GCN-based solutions under different
  benchmark settings, without bells and whistles. Code and models are available at
