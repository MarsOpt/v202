title: 'Great Models Think Alike: Improving Model Reliability via Inter-Model Latent
  Agreement'
openreview: UfZuIrHhRu
abstract: Reliable application of machine learning is of primary importance to the
  practical deployment of deep learning methods. A fundamental challenge is that models
  are often unreliable due to overconfidence. In this paper, we estimate a model’s
  reliability by measuring the agreement between its latent space, and the latent
  space of a foundation model. However, it is challenging to measure the agreement
  between two different latent spaces due to their incoherence, e.g., arbitrary rotations
  and different dimensionality. To overcome this incoherence issue, we design a neighborhood
  agreement measure between latent spaces and find that this agreement is surprisingly
  well-correlated with the reliability of a model’s predictions. Further, we show
  that fusing neighborhood agreement into a model’s predictive confidence in a post-hoc
  way significantly improves its reliability. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments
  on failure detection across various datasets verify the effectiveness of our method
  on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.
