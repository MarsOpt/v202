title: A Kernel Stein Test of Goodness of Fit for Sequential Models
openreview: XxMRhjbDGq
abstract: 'We propose a goodness-of-fit measure for probability densities modeling
  observations with varying dimensionality, such as text documents of differing lengths
  or variable-length sequences. The proposed measure is an instance of the kernel
  Stein discrepancy (KSD), which has been used to construct goodness-of-fit tests
  for unnormalized densities. The KSD is defined by its Stein operator: current operators
  used in testing apply to fixed-dimensional spaces. As our main contribution, we
  extend the KSD to the variable-dimension setting by identifying appropriate Stein
  operators, and propose a novel KSD goodness-of-fit test. As with the previous variants,
  the proposed KSD does not require the density to be normalized, allowing the evaluation
  of a large class of models. Our test is shown to perform well in practice on discrete
  sequential data benchmarks.'
