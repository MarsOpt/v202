title: Robust and private stochastic linear bandits
openreview: r3M5cBtpYq
abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic linear bandit problem under the additional
  requirements of <em>differential privacy</em>, <em>robustness</em> and <em>batched
  observations</em>. In particular, we assume an adversary randomly chooses a constant
  fraction of the observed rewards in each batch, replacing them with arbitrary numbers.
  We present differentially private and robust variants of the arm elimination algorithm
  using logarithmic batch queries under two privacy models and provide regret bounds
  in both settings. In the first model, every reward in each round is reported by
  a potentially different client, which reduces to standard local differential privacy
  (LDP). In the second model, every action is "owned" by a different client, who may
  aggregate the rewards over multiple queries and privatize the aggregate response
  instead. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the first simultaneously
  providing differential privacy and adversarial robustness in the stochastic linear
  bandits problem.
