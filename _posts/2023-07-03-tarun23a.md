title: Deep Regression Unlearning
openreview: oJANAXYc18
abstract: 'With the introduction of data protection and privacy regulations, it has
  become crucial to remove the lineage of data on demand from a machine learning (ML)
  model. In the last few years, there have been notable developments in machine unlearning
  to remove the information of certain training data efficiently and effectively from
  ML models. In this work, we explore unlearning for the regression problem, particularly
  in deep learning models. Unlearning in classification and simple linear regression
  has been considerably investigated. However, unlearning in deep regression models
  largely remains an untouched problem till now. In this work, we introduce deep regression
  unlearning methods that generalize well and are robust to privacy attacks. We propose
  the Blindspot unlearning method which uses a novel weight optimization process.
  A randomly initialized model, partially exposed to the retain samples and a copy
  of the original model are used together to selectively imprint knowledge about the
  data that we wish to keep and scrub off the information of the data we wish to forget.
  We also propose a Gaussian fine tuning method for regression unlearning. The existing
  unlearning metrics for classification are not directly applicable to regression
  unlearning. Therefore, we adapt these metrics for the regression setting. We conduct
  regression unlearning experiments for computer vision, natural language processing
  and forecasting applications. Our methods show excellent performance for all these
  datasets across all the metrics. Source code: https://github.com/ayu987/deep-regression-unlearning'
