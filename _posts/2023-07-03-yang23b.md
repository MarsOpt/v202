title: 'Nested Elimination: A Simple Algorithm for Best-Item Identification From Choice-Based
  Feedback'
openreview: qn9ZWZ3Pg7
abstract: We study the problem of best-item identification from choice-based feedback.
  In this problem, a company sequentially and adaptively shows display sets to a population
  of customers and collects their choices. The objective is to identify the most preferred
  item with the least number of samples and at a high confidence level. We propose
  an elimination-based algorithm, namely Nested Elimination (NE), which is inspired
  by the nested structure implied by the information-theoretic lower bound. NE is
  simple in structure, easy to implement, and has a strong theoretical guarantee for
  sample complexity. Specifically, NE utilizes an innovative elimination criterion
  and circumvents the need to solve any complex combinatorial optimization problem.
  We provide an instance-specific and non-asymptotic bound on the expected sample
  complexity of NE. We also show NE achieves high-order worst-case asymptotic optimality.
  Finally, numerical experiments from both synthetic and real data corroborate our
  theoretical findings.
