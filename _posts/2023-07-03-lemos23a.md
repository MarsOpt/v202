title: Sampling-Based Accuracy Testing of Posterior Estimators for General Inference
openreview: v6izzusLDO
abstract: Parameter inference, i.e. inferring the posterior distribution of the parameters
  of a statistical model given some data, is a central problem to many scientific
  disciplines. Posterior inference with generative models is an alternative to methods
  such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, both for likelihood-based and simulation-based
  inference. However, assessing the accuracy of posteriors encoded in generative models
  is not straightforward. In this paper, we introduce "Tests of Accuracy with Random
  Points" (TARP) coverage testing as a method to estimate coverage probabilities of
  generative posterior estimators. Our method differs from previously-existing coverage-based
  methods, which require posterior evaluations. We prove that our approach is necessary
  and sufficient to show that a posterior estimator is accurate. We demonstrate the
  method on a variety of synthetic examples, and show that TARP can be used to test
  the results of posterior inference analyses in high-dimensional spaces. We also
  show that our method can detect inaccurate inferences in cases where existing methods
  fail.
