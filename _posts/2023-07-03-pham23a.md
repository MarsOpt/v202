title: A Scalable Frank-Wolfe-Based Algorithm for the Max-Cut SDP
openreview: HaPz0YuD78
abstract: We consider the problem of solving large-scale instances of the Max-Cut
  semidefinite program (SDP), i.e., optimizing a linear function over $n\times n$
  positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with unit diagonal. When the cost matrix is
  PSD, we show how to exactly reformulate the problem as maximizing a smooth concave
  function over PSD matrices with unit trace. By applying the Frank-Wolfe method,
  we obtain a simple algorithm that is compatible with recent sampling-based techniques
  to solve SDPs using low memory. We demonstrate the practical performance of our
  method on $10^6\times 10^6$ instances of the max-cut SDP with costs having up to
  $5 \times 10^6$ non-zero entries. Theoretically, we show that our method solves
  problems with diagonally dominant costs to relative error $\epsilon$ in $O(n\epsilon^{-1})$
  calls to a randomized approximate largest eigenvalue subroutine, each of which succeeds
  with high probability after $O(\log(n)\epsilon^{-1/2})$ matrix-vector multiplications
  with the cost matrix.
