title: Feature learning in deep classifiers through Intermediate Neural Collapse
openreview: XbggSPNB9W
abstract: In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of the feature learning process
  in deep classifiers. Recent research has identified a training phenomenon called
  Neural Collapse (NC), in which the top-layer feature embeddings of samples from
  the same class tend to concentrate around their means, and the top layerâ€™s weights
  align with those features. Our study aims to investigate if these properties extend
  to intermediate layers. We empirically study the evolution of the covariance and
  mean of representations across different layers and show that as we move deeper
  into a trained neural network, the within-class covariance decreases relative to
  the between-class covariance. Additionally, we find that in the top layers, where
  the between-class covariance is dominant, the subspace spanned by the class means
  aligns with the subspace spanned by the most significant singular vector components
  of the weight matrix in the corresponding layer. Finally, we discuss the relationship
  between NC and Associative Memories (Willshaw et. al. 1969).
