title: Regions of Reliability in the Evaluation of Multivariate Probabilistic Forecasts
openreview: gTGFxnBymb
abstract: Multivariate probabilistic time series forecasts are commonly evaluated
  via proper scoring rules, i.e., functions that are minimal in expectation for the
  ground-truth distribution. However, this property is not sufficient to guarantee
  good discrimination in the non-asymptotic regime. In this paper, we provide the
  first systematic finite-sample study of proper scoring rules for time series forecasting
  evaluation. Through a power analysis, we identify the “region of reliability” of
  a scoring rule, i.e., the set of practical conditions where it can be relied on
  to identify forecasting errors. We carry out our analysis on a comprehensive synthetic
  benchmark, specifically designed to test several key discrepancies between ground-truth
  and forecast distributions, and we gauge the generalizability of our findings to
  real-world tasks with an application to an electricity production problem. Our results
  reveal critical shortcomings in the evaluation of multivariate probabilistic forecasts
  as commonly performed in the literature.
