title: 'Finding the Missing-half: Graph Complementary Learning for Homophily-prone
  and Heterophily-prone Graphs'
openreview: KiUDs8yWX4
abstract: 'Real-world graphs generally have only one kind of tendency in their connections.
  These connections are either homophilic-prone or heterophily-prone. While graphs
  with homophily-prone edges tend to connect nodes with the same class (i.e., intra-class
  nodes), heterophily-prone edges tend to build relationships between nodes with different
  classes (i.e., inter-class nodes). Existing GNNs only take the original graph as
  input during training. The problem with this approach is that it forgets to take
  into consideration the ”missing-half” structural information, that is, heterophily-prone
  topology for homophily-prone graphs and homophily-prone topology for heterophily-prone
  graphs. In our paper, we introduce Graph cOmplementAry Learning, namely GOAL, which
  consists of two components: graph complementation and complemented graph convolution.
  The first component finds the missing-half structural information for a given graph
  to complement it. The complemented graph has two sets of graphs including both homophily-
  and heterophily-prone topology. In the latter component, to handle complemented
  graphs, we design a new graph convolution from the perspective of optimisation.
  The experiment results show that GOAL consistently outperforms all baselines in
  eight real-world datasets.'
