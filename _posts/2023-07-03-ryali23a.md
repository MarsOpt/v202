title: 'Hiera: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer without the Bells-and-Whistles'
openreview: XQuXfVR5Wx
abstract: Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific
  components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these
  components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity
  actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In
  this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with
  a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles
  from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy.
  In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer
  that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both
  at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image
  and video recognition. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/hiera.
