title: Robust Perception through Equivariance
openreview: IFES1ufJlh
abstract: Deep networks for computer vision are not reliable when they encounter adversarial
  examples. In this paper, we introduce a framework that uses the dense intrinsic
  constraints in natural images to robustify inference. By introducing constraints
  at inference time, we can shift the burden of robustness from training to testing,
  thereby allowing the model to dynamically adjust to each individual imageâ€™s unique
  and potentially novel characteristics at inference time. Our theoretical results
  show the importance of having dense constraints at inference time. In contrast to
  existing single-constraint methods, we propose to use equivariance, which naturally
  allows dense constraints at a fine-grained level in the feature space. Our empirical
  experiments show that restoring feature equivariance at inference time defends against
  worst-case adversarial perturbations. The method obtains improved adversarial robustness
  on four datasets (ImageNet, Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and MS-COCO) on image recognition,
  semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation tasks.
