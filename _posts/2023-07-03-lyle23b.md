title: Understanding Plasticity in Neural Networks
openreview: odqQB2OXsG
abstract: Plasticity, the ability of a neural network to quickly change its predictions
  in response to new information, is essential for the adaptability and robustness
  of deep reinforcement learning systems. Deep neural networks are known to lose plasticity
  over the course of training even in relatively simple learning problems, but the
  mechanisms driving this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This paper conducts
  a systematic empirical analysis into plasticity loss, with the goal of understanding
  the phenomenon mechanistically in order to guide the future development of targeted
  solutions. We find that loss of plasticity is deeply connected to changes in the
  curvature of the loss landscape, but that it often occurs in the absence of saturated
  units. Based on this insight, we identify a number of parameterization and optimization
  design choices which enable networks to better preserve plasticity over the course
  of training. We validate the utility of these findings on larger-scale RL benchmarks
  in the Arcade Learning Environment.
