title: 'DUET: 2D Structured and Approximately Equivariant Representations'
openreview: 2tuJDwSSP2
abstract: Multiview Self-Supervised Learning (MSSL) is based on learning invariances
  with respect to a set of input transformations. However, invariance partially or
  totally removes transformation-related information from the representations, which
  might harm performance for specific downstream tasks that require such information.
  We propose 2D strUctured and EquivarianT representations (coined DUET), which are
  2d representations organized in a matrix structure, and equivariant with respect
  to transformations acting on the input data. DUET representations maintain information
  about an input transformation, while remaining semantically expressive. Compared
  to SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) (unstructured and invariant) and ESSL (Dangovski et
  al., 2022) (unstructured and equivariant), the structured and equivariant nature
  of DUET representations enables controlled generation with lower reconstruction
  error, while controllability is not possible with SimCLR or ESSL. DUET also achieves
  higher accuracy for several discriminative tasks, and improves transfer learning.
