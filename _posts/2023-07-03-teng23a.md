title: Finding Generalization Measures by Contrasting Signal and Noise
openreview: PQgjker1cd
abstract: Generalization is one of the most fundamental challenges in deep learning,
  aiming to predict model performances on unseen data. Empirically, such predictions
  usually rely on a validation set, while recent works showed that an unlabeled validation
  set also works. Without validation sets, it is extremely difficult to obtain non-vacuous
  generalization bounds, which leads to a weaker task of finding generalization measures
  that monotonically relate to generalization error. In this paper, we propose a new
  generalization measure REF Complexity (RElative Fitting degree between signal and
  noise), motivated by the intuition that a given model-algorithm pair may generalize
  well if it fits signal (e.g., true labels) fast while fitting noise (e.g., random
  labels) slowly. Empirically, REF Complexity monotonically relates to test accuracy
  in real-world datasets without accessing additional validation sets, achieving -0.988
  correlation on CIFAR-10 and -0.960 correlation on CIFAR-100. We further theoretically
  verify the utility of REF Complexity under three different cases, including convex
  and smooth regimes with stochastic gradient descent, smooth regimes (not necessarily
  convex) with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, and linear regimes with gradient
  descent. The code is available at https://github.com/962086838/REF-complexity.
