title: Optimal randomized multilevel Monte Carlo for repeatedly nested expectations
openreview: gy5bhRzsex
abstract: The estimation of repeatedly nested expectations is a challenging task that
  arises in many real-world systems. However, existing methods generally suffer from
  high computational costs when the number of nestings becomes large. Fix any non-negative
  integer $D$ for the total number of nestings. Standard Monte Carlo methods typically
  cost at least $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-(2+D)})$ and sometimes $\mathcal {O}(\varepsilon^{-2(1+D)})$
  to obtain an estimator up to $\varepsilon$-error. More advanced methods, such as
  multilevel Monte Carlo, currently only exist for $D = 1$. In this paper, we propose
  a novel Monte Carlo estimator called $\mathsf{READ}$, which stands for “Recursive
  Estimator for Arbitrary Depth.” Our estimator has an optimal computational cost
  of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ for every fixed $D$ under suitable assumptions,
  and a nearly optimal computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2(1 + \delta)})$
  for any $0 < \delta < \frac12$ under much more general assumptions. Our estimator
  is also unbiased, which makes it easy to parallelize. The key ingredients in our
  construction are an observation of the problem’s recursive structure and the recursive
  use of the randomized multilevel Monte Carlo method.
