title: 'FARE: Provably Fair Representation Learning with Practical Certificates'
openreview: GUQRyGhmxv
abstract: Fair representation learning (FRL) is a popular class of methods aiming
  to produce fair classifiers via data preprocessing. Recent regulatory directives
  stress the need for FRL methods that provide practical certificates, i.e., provable
  upper bounds on the unfairness of any downstream classifier trained on preprocessed
  data, which directly provides assurance in a practical scenario. Creating such FRL
  methods is an important challenge that remains unsolved. In this work, we address
  that challenge and introduce FARE (Fairness with Restricted Encoders), the first
  FRL method with practical fairness certificates. FARE is based on our key insight
  that restricting the representation space of the encoder enables the derivation
  of practical guarantees, while still permitting favorable accuracy-fairness tradeoffs
  for suitable instantiations, such as one we propose based on fair trees. To produce
  a practical certificate, we develop and apply a statistical procedure that computes
  a finite sample high-confidence upper bound on the unfairness of any downstream
  classifier trained on FARE embeddings. In our comprehensive experimental evaluation,
  we demonstrate that FARE produces practical certificates that are tight and often
  even comparable with purely empirical results obtained by prior methods, which establishes
  the practical value of our approach.
