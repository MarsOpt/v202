title: Bidirectional Looking with A Novel Double Exponential Moving Average to Adaptive
  and Non-adaptive Momentum Optimizers
openreview: AoYswkQ0Xf
abstract: Optimizer is an essential component for the success of deep learning, which
  guides the neural network to update the parameters according to the loss on the
  training set. SGD and Adam are two classical and effective optimizers on which researchers
  have proposed many variants, such as SGDM and RAdam. In this paper, we innovatively
  combine the backward-looking and forward-looking aspects of the optimizer algorithm
  and propose a novel Admeta (<b>A</b> <b>D</b>ouble exponential <b>M</b>oving averag<b>E</b>
  <b>T</b>o <b>A</b>daptive and non-adaptive momentum) optimizer framework. For backward-looking
  part, we propose a DEMA variant scheme, which is motivated by a metric in the stock
  market, to replace the common exponential moving average scheme. While in the forward-looking
  part, we present a dynamic lookahead strategy which asymptotically approaches a
  set value, maintaining its speed at early stage and high convergence performance
  at final stage. Based on this idea, we provide two optimizer implementations, AdmetaR
  and AdmetaS, the former based on RAdam and the latter based on SGDM. Through extensive
  experiments on diverse tasks, we find that the proposed Admeta optimizer outperforms
  our base optimizers and shows advantages over recently proposed competitive optimizers.
  We also provide theoretical proof of these two algorithms, which verifies the convergence
  of our proposed Admeta.
