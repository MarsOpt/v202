title: 'MolDiff: Addressing the Atom-Bond Inconsistency Problem in 3D Molecule Diffusion
  Generation'
openreview: gfGLMZR27W
abstract: Deep generative models have recently achieved superior performance in 3D
  molecule generation. Most of them first generate atoms and then add chemical bonds
  based on the generated atoms in a post-processing manner. However, there might be
  no corresponding bond solution for the temporally generated atoms as their locations
  are generated without considering potential bonds. We define this problem as the
  atom-bond inconsistency problem and claim it is the main reason for current approaches
  to generating unrealistic 3D molecules. To overcome this problem, we propose a new
  diffusion model called MolDiff which can generate atoms and bonds simultaneously
  while still maintaining their consistency by explicitly modeling the dependence
  between their relationships. We evaluated the generation ability of our proposed
  model and the quality of the generated molecules using criteria related to both
  geometry and chemical properties. The empirical studies showed that our model outperforms
  previous approaches, achieving a three-fold improvement in success rate and generating
  molecules with significantly better quality.
