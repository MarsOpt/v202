title: Efficient Learning of Mesh-Based Physical Simulation with Bi-Stride Multi-Scale
  Graph Neural Network
openreview: 2Mbo7IEtZW
abstract: Learning the long-range interactions on large-scale mesh-based physical
  systems with flat Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and stacking Message Passings (MPs)
  is challenging due to the scaling complexity w.r.t. the number of nodes and over-smoothing.
  Therefore, there has been growing interest in the community to introduce <em>multi-scale</em>
  structures to GNNs for physics simulation. However, current state-of-the-art methods
  are limited by their reliance on the labor-heavy drawing of coarser meshes or building
  coarser levels based on spatial proximity, which can introduce wrong edges across
  geometry boundaries. Inspired by the bipartite graph determination, we propose a
  novel pooling strategy, <em>bi-stride</em> to tackle the aforementioned limitations.
  Bi-stride pools nodes on every other frontier of the Breadth-First-Search (BFS),
  without the need for the manual drawing of coarser meshes and, avoid wrong edges
  introduced by spatial proximity. Additionally, it enables a reduced number of MP
  times on each level and the non-parametrized pooling and unpooling by interpolations,
  similar to convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which significantly reduces computational
  requirements. Experiments show that the proposed framework, <em>BSMS-GNN</em>, significantly
  outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency
  in representative physics-based simulation scenarios.
