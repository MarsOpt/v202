title: 'A Unified Optimization Framework of ANN-SNN Conversion: Towards Optimal Mapping
  from Activation Values to Firing Rates'
openreview: 6nFolgGq9E
abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention for their
  energy-efficient and fast-inference capabilities, but training SNNs from scratch
  can be challenging due to the discrete nature of spikes. One alternative method
  is to convert an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into an SNN, known as ANN-SNN conversion.
  Currently, existing ANN-SNN conversion methods often involve redesigning the ANN
  with a new activation function, rather than utilizing the traditional ReLU, and
  converting it to an SNN. However, these methods do not take into account the potential
  performance loss between the regular ANN with ReLU and the tailored ANN. In this
  work, we propose a unified optimization framework for ANN-SNN conversion that considers
  both performance loss and conversion error. To achieve this, we introduce the SlipReLU
  activation function, which is a weighted sum of the threshold-ReLU and the step
  function. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that conversion error can be zero on
  a range of shift values $\delta \in [-0.5,0.5]$ rather than a fixed shift term 0.5.
  We evaluate our SlipReLU method on CIFAR datasets, which shows that SlipReLU outperforms
  current ANN-SNN conversion methods and supervised training methods in terms of accuracy
  and latency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ANN-SNN conversion
  method that enables SNN inference using only 1 time step. Code is available at https://github.com/HaiyanJiang/SNN_Conversion_unified.
