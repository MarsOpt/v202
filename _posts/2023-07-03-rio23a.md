title: Multi-Agent Best Arm Identification with Private Communications
openreview: T27zdeulEK
abstract: 'We address multi-agent best arm identification with privacy guarantees.
  In this setting, agents collaborate by communicating to find the optimal arm. To
  avoid leaking sensitive data through messages, we consider two notions of privacy
  withholding different kinds of information: differential privacy and $(\epsilon,
  \eta)$-privacy. For each privacy definition, we propose an algorithm based on a
  two-level successive elimination scheme. We provide theoretical guarantees for the
  privacy level, accuracy and sample complexity of our algorithms. Experiments on
  various settings support our theoretical findings.'
