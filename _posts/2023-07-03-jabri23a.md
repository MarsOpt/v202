title: Scalable Adaptive Computation for Iterative Generation
openreview: 1FldU7JzGh
abstract: Natural data is redundant yet predominant architectures tile computation
  uniformly across their input and output space. We propose the Recurrent Interface
  Network (RIN), an attention-based architecture that decouples its core computation
  from the dimensionality of the data, enabling adaptive computation for more scalable
  generation of high-dimensional data. RINs focus the bulk of computation (i.e. global
  self-attention) on a set of latent tokens, using cross-attention to read and write
  (i.e. route) information between latent and data tokens. Stacking RIN blocks allows
  bottom-up (data to latent) and top-down (latent to data) feedback, leading to deeper
  and more expressive routing. While this routing introduces challenges, this is less
  problematic in recurrent computation settings where the task (and routing problem)
  changes gradually, such as iterative generation with diffusion models. We show how
  to leverage recurrence by conditioning the latent tokens at each forward pass of
  the reverse diffusion process with those from prior computation, i.e. latent self-conditioning.
  RINs yield state-of-the-art pixel diffusion models for image and video generation,
  scaling to1024×1024 images without cascades or guidance, while being domain-agnostic
  and up to 10× more efficient than 2D and 3D U-Nets.
