title: Node Embedding from Neural Hamiltonian Orbits in Graph Neural Networks
openreview: BKcq7TDWAT
abstract: 'In the graph node embedding problem, embedding spaces can vary significantly
  for different data types, leading to the need for different GNN model types. In
  this paper, we model the embedding update of a node feature as a Hamiltonian orbit
  over time. Since the Hamiltonian orbits generalize the exponential maps, this approach
  allows us to learn the underlying manifold of the graph in training, in contrast
  to most of the existing literature that assumes a fixed graph embedding manifold
  with a closed exponential map solution. Our proposed node embedding strategy can
  automatically learn, without extensive tuning, the underlying geometry of any given
  graph dataset even if it has diverse geometries. We test Hamiltonian functions of
  different forms and verify the performance of our approach on two graph node embedding
  downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. Numerical experiments
  demonstrate that our approach adapts better to different types of graph datasets
  than popular state-of-the-art graph node embedding GNNs. The code is available at
  https://github.com/zknus/Hamiltonian-GNN.'
