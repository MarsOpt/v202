title: A Simple Zero-shot Prompt Weighting Technique to Improve Prompt Ensembling
  in Text-Image Models
openreview: 6MU5xdrO7t
abstract: Contrastively trained text-image models have the remarkable ability to perform
  zero-shot classification, that is, classifying previously unseen images into categories
  that the model has never been explicitly trained to identify. However, these zero-shot
  classifiers need prompt engineering to achieve high accuracy. Prompt engineering
  typically requires hand-crafting a set of prompts for individual downstream tasks.
  In this work, we aim to automate this prompt engineering and improve zero-shot accuracy
  through prompt ensembling. In particular, we ask <em>â€œGiven a large pool of prompts,
  can we automatically score the prompts and ensemble those that are most suitable
  for a particular downstream dataset, without needing access to labeled validation
  data?"</em>. We demonstrate that this is possible. In doing so, we identify several
  pathologies in a naive prompt scoring method where the score can be easily overconfident
  due to biases in pre-training and test data, and we propose a novel prompt scoring
  method that corrects for the biases. Using our proposed scoring method to create
  a weighted average prompt ensemble, our method overall outperforms equal average
  ensemble, as well as hand-crafted prompts, on ImageNet, 4 of its variants, and 11
  fine-grained classification benchmarks. while being fully automatic, optimization-free,
  and not requiring access to labeled validation data.
