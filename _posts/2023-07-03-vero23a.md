title: 'TabLeak: Tabular Data Leakage in Federated Learning'
openreview: mRiDy4qGwB
abstract: 'While federated learning (FL) promises to preserve privacy, recent works
  in the image and text domains have shown that training updates leak private client
  data. However, most high-stakes applications of FL (e.g., in healthcare and finance)
  use tabular data, where the risk of data leakage has not yet been explored. A successful
  attack for tabular data must address two key challenges unique to the domain: (i)
  obtaining a solution to a high-variance mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem,
  and (ii) enabling human assessment of the reconstruction as unlike for image and
  text data, direct human inspection is not possible. In this work we address these
  challenges and propose TabLeak, the first comprehensive reconstruction attack on
  tabular data. TabLeak is based on two key contributions: (i) a method which leverages
  a softmax relaxation and pooled ensembling to solve the optimization problem, and
  (ii) an entropy-based uncertainty quantification scheme to enable human assessment.
  We evaluate TabLeak on four tabular datasets for both FedSGD and FedAvg training
  protocols, and show that it successfully breaks several settings previously deemed
  safe. For instance, we extract large subsets of private data at $>$90% accuracy
  even at the large batch size of 128. Our findings demonstrate that current high-stakes
  tabular FL is excessively vulnerable to leakage attacks.'
