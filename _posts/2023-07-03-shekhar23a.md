title: Sequential Changepoint Detection via Backward Confidence Sequences
openreview: QT5Cphscf2
abstract: We present a simple reduction from sequential estimation to sequential changepoint
  detection (SCD). In short, suppose we are interested in detecting changepoints in
  some parameter or functional $\theta$ of the underlying distribution. We demonstrate
  that if we can construct a confidence sequence (CS) for $\theta$, then we can also
  successfully perform SCD for $\theta$. This is accomplished by checking if two CSs
  — one forwards and the other backwards — ever fail to intersect. Since the literature
  on CSs has been rapidly evolving recently, the reduction provided in this paper
  immediately solves several old and new change detection problems. Further, our “backward
  CS”, constructed by reversing time, is new and potentially of independent interest.
  We provide strong nonasymptotic guarantees on the frequency of false alarms and
  detection delay, and demonstrate numerical effectiveness on several problems.
