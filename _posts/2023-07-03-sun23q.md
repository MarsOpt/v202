title: Model-Bellman Inconsistency for Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning
openreview: rwLwGPdzDD
abstract: For offline reinforcement learning (RL), model-based methods are expected
  to be data-efficient as they incorporate dynamics models to generate more data.
  However, due to inevitable model errors, straightforwardly learning a policy in
  the model typically fails in the offline setting. Previous studies have incorporated
  conservatism to prevent out-of-distribution exploration. For example, MOPO penalizes
  rewards through uncertainty measures from predicting the next states, which we have
  discovered are loose bounds of the ideal uncertainty, i.e., the Bellman error. In
  this work, we propose MOdel-Bellman Inconsistency penalized offLinE Policy Optimization
  (MOBILE), a novel uncertainty-driven offline RL algorithm. MOBILE conducts uncertainty
  quantification through the inconsistency of Bellman estimations under an ensemble
  of learned dynamics models, which can be a better approximator to the true Bellman
  error, and penalizes the Bellman estimation based on this uncertainty. Empirically
  we have verified that our proposed uncertainty quantification can be significantly
  closer to the true Bellman error than the compared methods. Consequently, MOBILE
  outperforms prior offline RL approaches on most tasks of D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks.
