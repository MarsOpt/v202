title: 'Shiftable Context: Addressing Training-Inference Context Mismatch in Simultaneous
  Speech Translation'
openreview: mlsNi1IDjY
abstract: Transformer models using segment-based processing have been an effective
  architecture for simultaneous speech translation. However, such models create a
  context mismatch between training and inference environments, hindering potential
  translation accuracy. We solve this issue by proposing Shiftable Context, a simple
  yet effective scheme to ensure that consistent segment and context sizes are maintained
  throughout training and inference, even with the presence of partially filled segments
  due to the streaming nature of simultaneous translation. Shiftable Context is also
  broadly applicable to segment-based transformers for streaming tasks. Our experiments
  on the English-German, English-French, and English-Spanish language pairs from the
  MUST-C dataset demonstrate that when applied to the Augmented Memory Transformer,
  a state-of-the-art model for simultaneous speech translation, the proposed scheme
  achieves an average increase of 2.09, 1.83, and 1.95 BLEU scores across each wait-k
  value for the three language pairs, respectively, with a minimal impact on computation-aware
  Average Lagging.
