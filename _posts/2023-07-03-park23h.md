title: Controllability-Aware Unsupervised Skill Discovery
openreview: Ct2N6RWZpQ
abstract: One of the key capabilities of intelligent agents is the ability to discover
  useful skills without external supervision. However, the current unsupervised skill
  discovery methods are often limited to acquiring simple, easy-to-learn skills due
  to the lack of incentives to discover more complex, challenging behaviors. We introduce
  a novel unsupervised skill discovery method, Controllability-aware Skill Discovery
  (CSD), which actively seeks complex, hard-to-control skills without supervision.
  The key component of CSD is a controllability-aware distance function, which assigns
  larger values to state transitions that are harder to achieve with the current skills.
  Combined with distance-maximizing skill discovery, CSD progressively learns more
  challenging skills over the course of training as our jointly trained distance function
  reduces rewards for easy-to-achieve skills. Our experimental results in six robotic
  manipulation and locomotion environments demonstrate that CSD can discover diverse
  complex skills including object manipulation and locomotion skills with no supervision,
  significantly outperforming prior unsupervised skill discovery methods. Videos and
  code are available at https://seohong.me/projects/csd/
