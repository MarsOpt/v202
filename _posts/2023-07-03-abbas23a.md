title: 'ClusterFuG: Clustering Fully connected Graphs by Multicut'
openreview: IK5SlumdGu
abstract: We propose a graph clustering formulation based on multicut (a.k.a. weighted
  correlation clustering) on the complete graph. Our formulation does not need specification
  of the graph topology as in the original sparse formulation of multicut, making
  our approach simpler and potentially better performing. In contrast to unweighted
  correlation clustering we allow for a more expressive weighted cost structure. In
  dense multicut, the clustering objective is given in a factorized form as inner
  products of node feature vectors. This allows for an efficient formulation and inference
  in contrast to multicut/weighted correlation clustering, which has at least quadratic
  representation and computation complexity when working on the complete graph. We
  show how to rewrite classical greedy algorithms for multicut in our dense setting
  and how to modify them for greater efficiency and solution quality. In particular,
  our algorithms scale to graphs with tens of thousands of nodes. Empirical evidence
  on instance segmentation on Cityscapes and clustering of ImageNet datasets shows
  the merits of our approach.
