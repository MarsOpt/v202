title: Distribution Free Domain Generalization
openreview: CERS3hZIrH
abstract: Accurate prediction of the out-of-distribution data is desired for a learning
  algorithm. In domain generalization, training data from source domains tend to have
  different distributions from that of the target domain, while the target data are
  absence in the training process. We propose a Distribution Free Domain Generalization
  (DFDG) procedure for classification by conducting standardization to avoid the dominance
  of a few domains in the training process. The essence of the DFDG is its reformulating
  the cross domain/class discrepancy by pairwise two sample test statistics, and equally
  weights their importance or the covariance structures to avoid dominant domain/class.
  A theoretical generalization bound is established for the multi-class classification
  problem. The DFDG is shown to offer a superior performance in empirical studies
  with fewer hyperparameters, which means faster and easier implementation.
