title: 'ELSA: Efficient Label Shift Adaptation through the Lens of Semiparametric
  Models'
openreview: tCCwr7SmAM
abstract: We study the domain adaptation problem with label shift in this work. Under
  the label shift context, the marginal distribution of the label varies across the
  training and testing datasets, while the conditional distribution of features given
  the label is the same. Traditional label shift adaptation methods either suffer
  from large estimation errors or require cumbersome post-prediction calibrations.
  To address these issues, we first propose a moment-matching framework for adapting
  the label shift based on the geometry of the influence function. Under such a framework,
  we propose a novel method named $\underline{\mathrm{E}}$fficient $\underline{\mathrm{L}}$abel
  $\underline{\mathrm{S}}$hift $\underline{\mathrm{A}}$daptation (ELSA), in which
  the adaptation weights can be estimated by solving linear systems. Theoretically,
  the ELSA estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent ($n$ is the sample size of the source
  data) and asymptotically normal. Empirically, we show that ELSA can achieve state-of-the-art
  estimation performances without post-prediction calibrations, thus, gaining computational
  efficiency.
