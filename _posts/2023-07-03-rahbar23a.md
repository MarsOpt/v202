title: 'Recovery Bounds on Class-Based Optimal Transport: A Sum-of-Norms Regularization
  Framework'
openreview: mt4j86X6Py
abstract: We develop a novel theoretical framework for understating Optimal Transport
  (OT) schemes respecting a class structure. For this purpose, we propose a convex
  OT program with a sum-of-norms regularization term, which provably recovers the
  underlying class structure under geometric assumptions. Furthermore, we derive an
  accelerated proximal algorithm with a closed-form projection and proximal operator
  scheme, thereby affording a more scalable algorithm for computing optimal transport
  plans. We provide a novel argument for the uniqueness of the optimum even in the
  absence of strong convexity. Our experiments show that the new regularizer not only
  results in a better preservation of the class structure in the data but also yields
  additional robustness to the data geometry, compared to previous regularizers.
