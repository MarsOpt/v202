title: 'Building Neural Networks on Matrix Manifolds: A Gyrovector Space Approach'
openreview: kjEKnLhZQV
abstract: Matrix manifolds, such as manifolds of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)
  matrices and Grassmann manifolds, appear in many applications. Recently, by applying
  the theory of gyrogroups and gyrovector spaces that is a powerful framework for
  studying hyperbolic geometry, some works have attempted to build principled generalizations
  of Euclidean neural networks on matrix manifolds. However, due to the lack of many
  concepts in gyrovector spaces for the considered manifolds, e.g., the inner product
  and gyroangles, techniques and mathematical tools provided by these works are still
  limited compared to those developed for studying hyperbolic geometry. In this paper,
  we generalize some notions in gyrovector spaces for SPD and Grassmann manifolds,
  and propose new models and layers for building neural networks on these manifolds.
  We show the effectiveness of our approach in two applications, i.e., human action
  recognition and knowledge graph completion.
