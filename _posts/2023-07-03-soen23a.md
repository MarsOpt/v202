title: Fair Densities via Boosting the Sufficient Statistics of Exponential Families
openreview: mwYHi3V56U
abstract: We introduce a boosting algorithm to pre-process data for fairness. Starting
  from an initial fair but inaccurate distribution, our approach shifts towards better
  data fitting while still ensuring a minimal fairness guarantee. To do so, it learns
  the sufficient statistics of an exponential family with boosting-compliant convergence.
  Importantly, we are able to theoretically prove that the learned distribution will
  have a representation rate and statistical rate data fairness guarantee. Unlike
  recent optimization based pre-processing methods, our approach can be easily adapted
  for continuous domain features. Furthermore, when the weak learners are specified
  to be decision trees, the sufficient statistics of the learned distribution can
  be examined to provide clues on sources of (un)fairness. Empirical results are present
  to display the quality of result on real-world data.
