title: A Deep Conjugate Direction Method for Iteratively Solving Linear Systems
openreview: TvILWDB5ke
abstract: We present a novel deep learning approach to approximate the solution of
  large, sparse, symmetric, positive-definite linear systems of equations. Motivated
  by the conjugate gradients algorithm that iteratively selects search directions
  for minimizing the matrix norm of the approximation error, we design an approach
  that utilizes a deep neural network to accelerate convergence via data-driven improvement
  of the search direction at each iteration. Our method leverages a carefully chosen
  convolutional network to approximate the action of the inverse of the linear operator
  up to an arbitrary constant. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on spatially
  discretized Poisson equations, which arise in computational fluid dynamics applications,
  with millions of degrees of freedom. Unlike state-of-the-art learning approaches,
  our algorithm is capable of reducing the linear system residual to a given tolerance
  in a small number of iterations, independent of the problem size. Moreover, our
  method generalizes effectively to various systems beyond those encountered during
  training.
