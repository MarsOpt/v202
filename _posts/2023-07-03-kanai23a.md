title: One-vs-the-Rest Loss to Focus on Important Samples in Adversarial Training
openreview: S9WJvVZ3Ly
abstract: This paper proposes a new loss function for adversarial training. Since
  adversarial training has difficulties, e.g., necessity of high model capacity, focusing
  on important data points by weighting cross-entropy loss has attracted much attention.
  However, they are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, e.g., Auto-Attack. This paper
  experimentally reveals that the cause of their vulnerability is their small margins
  between logits for the true label and the other labels. Since neural networks classify
  the data points based on the logits, logit margins should be large enough to avoid
  flipping the largest logit by the attacks. Importance-aware methods do not increase
  logit margins of important samples but decrease those of less-important samples
  compared with cross-entropy loss. To increase logit margins of important samples,
  we propose switching one-vs-the-rest loss (SOVR), which switches from cross-entropy
  to one-vs-the-rest loss for important samples that have small logit margins. We
  prove that one-vs-the-rest loss increases logit margins two times larger than the
  weighted cross-entropy loss for a simple problem. We experimentally confirm that
  SOVR increases logit margins of important samples unlike existing methods and achieves
  better robustness against Auto-Attack than importance-aware methods.
