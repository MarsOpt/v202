title: Geometric Clifford Algebra Networks
openreview: DNAJdkHPQ5
abstract: We propose Geometric Clifford Algebra Networks (GCANs) for modeling dynamical
  systems. GCANs are based on symmetry group transformations using geometric (Clifford)
  algebras. We first review the quintessence of modern (plane-based) geometric algebra,
  which builds on isometries encoded as elements of the $\mathrm{Pin}(p,q,r)$ group.
  We then propose the concept of group action layers, which linearly combine object
  transformations using pre-specified group actions. Together with a new activation
  and normalization scheme, these layers serve as adjustable geometric templates that
  can be refined via gradient descent. Theoretical advantages are strongly reflected
  in the modeling of three-dimensional rigid body transformations as well as large-scale
  fluid dynamics simulations, showing significantly improved performance over traditional
  methods.
