title: Searching Large Neighborhoods for Integer Linear Programs with Contrastive
  Learning
openreview: JLqPTrwqVD
abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are powerful tools for modeling and solving
  a large number of combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, it has been shown
  that Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), as a heuristic algorithm, can find high-quality
  solutions to ILPs faster than Branch and Bound. However, how to find the right heuristics
  to maximize the performance of LNS remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose
  a novel approach, CL-LNS, that delivers state-of-the-art anytime performance on
  several ILP benchmarks measured by metrics including the primal gap, the primal
  integral, survival rates and the best performing rate. Specifically, CL-LNS collects
  positive and negative solution samples from an expert heuristic that is slow to
  compute and learns a more efficient one with contrastive learning. We use graph
  attention networks and a richer set of features to further improve its performance.
