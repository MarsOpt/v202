title: 'DADAO: Decoupled Accelerated Decentralized Asynchronous Optimization'
openreview: 4k8saM66EH
abstract: 'This work introduces DADAO: the first decentralized, accelerated, asynchronous,
  primal, first-order algorithm to minimize a sum of $L$-smooth and $\mu$-strongly
  convex functions distributed over a given network of size $n$. Our key insight is
  based on modeling the local gradient updates and gossip communication procedures
  with separate independent Poisson Point Processes. This allows us to decouple the
  computation and communication steps, which can be run in parallel, while making
  the whole approach completely asynchronous. This leads to communication acceleration
  compared to synchronous approaches. Our new method employs primal gradients and
  does not use a multi-consensus inner loop nor other ad-hoc mechanisms such as Error
  Feedback, Gradient Tracking, or a Proximal operator. By relating the inverse of
  the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix $\chi_1$ and the maximal
  resistance $\chi_2\leq \chi_1$ of the graph to a sufficient minimal communication
  rate between the nodes of the network, we show that our algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$
  local gradients and only $\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt{\chi_1\chi_2}\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$
  communications to reach a precision $\epsilon$, up to logarithmic terms. Thus, we
  simultaneously obtain an accelerated rate for both computations and communications,
  leading to an improvement over state-of-the-art works, our simulations further validating
  the strength of our relatively unconstrained method.'
