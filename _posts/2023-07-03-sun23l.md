title: Momentum Ensures Convergence of SIGNSGD under Weaker Assumptions
openreview: a0kGwNUwil
abstract: Sign Stochastic Gradient Descent (signSGD) is a communication-efficient
  stochastic algorithm that only uses the sign information of the stochastic gradient
  to update the modelâ€™s weights. However, the existing convergence theory of signSGD
  either requires increasing batch sizes during training or assumes the gradient noise
  is symmetric and unimodal. Error feedback has been used to guarantee the convergence
  of signSGD under weaker assumptions at the cost of communication overhead. This
  paper revisits the convergence of signSGD and proves that momentum can remedy signSGD
  under weaker assumptions than previous techniques; in particular, our convergence
  theory does not require the assumption of bounded stochastic gradient or increased
  batch size. Our results resonate with echoes of previous empirical results where,
  unlike signSGD, signSGD with momentum maintains good performance even with small
  batch sizes. Another new result is that signSGD with momentum can achieve an improved
  convergence rate when the objective function is second-order smooth. We further
  extend our theory to signSGD with major vote and federated learning.
