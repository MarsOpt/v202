title: 'GFlowOut: Dropout with Generative Flow Networks'
openreview: 7R1gmDrfry
abstract: 'Bayesian inference offers principled tools to tackle many critical problems
  with modern neural networks such as poor calibration and generalization, and data
  inefficiency. However, scaling Bayesian inference to large architectures is challenging
  and requires restrictive approximations. Monte Carlo Dropout has been widely used
  as a relatively cheap way to approximate inference and estimate uncertainty with
  deep neural networks. Traditionally, the dropout mask is sampled independently from
  a fixed distribution. Recent research shows that the dropout mask can be seen as
  a latent variable, which can be inferred with variational inference. These methods
  face two important challenges: (a) the posterior distribution over masks can be
  highly multi-modal which can be difficult to approximate with standard variational
  inference and (b) it is not trivial to fully utilize sample-dependent information
  and correlation among dropout masks to improve posterior estimation. In this work,
  we propose GFlowOut to address these issues. GFlowOut leverages the recently proposed
  probabilistic framework of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to learn the posterior
  distribution over dropout masks. We empirically demonstrate that GFlowOut results
  in predictive distributions that generalize better to out-of-distribution data and
  provide uncertainty estimates which lead to better performance in downstream tasks.'
