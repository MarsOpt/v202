title: Bidirectional Learning for Offline Model-based Biological Sequence Design
openreview: CUORPu6abU
abstract: Offline model-based optimization aims to maximize a black-box objective
  function with a static dataset of designs and their scores. In this paper, we focus
  on biological sequence design to maximize some sequence score. A recent approach
  employs bidirectional learning, combining a forward mapping for exploitation and
  a backward mapping for constraint, and it relies on the neural tangent kernel (NTK)
  of an infinitely wide network to build a proxy model. Though effective, the NTK
  cannot learn features because of its parametrization, and its use prevents the incorporation
  of powerful pre-trained Language Models (LMs) that can capture the rich biophysical
  information in millions of biological sequences. We adopt an alternative proxy model,
  adding a linear head to a pre-trained LM, and propose a linearization scheme. This
  yields a closed-form loss and also takes into account the biophysical information
  in the pre-trained LM. In addition, the forward mapping and the backward mapping
  play different roles and thus deserve different weights during sequence optimization.
  To achieve this, we train an auxiliary model and leverage its weak supervision signal
  via a bi-level optimization framework to effectively learn how to balance the two
  mappings. Further, by extending the framework, we develop the first learning rate
  adaptation module <em>Adaptive</em>-$\eta$, which is compatible with all gradient-based
  algorithms for offline model-based optimization. Experimental results on DNA/protein
  sequence design tasks verify the effectiveness of our algorithm. Our code is available
