title: Calibrating Multimodal Learning
openreview: 4PgzyLz6hi
abstract: Multimodal machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in a wide range
  of scenarios. However, the reliability of multimodal learning remains largely unexplored.
  In this paper, through extensive empirical studies, we identify current multimodal
  classification methods suffer from unreliable predictive confidence that tend to
  rely on partial modalities when estimating confidence. Specifically, we find that
  the confidence estimated by current models could even increase when some modalities
  are corrupted. To address the issue, we introduce an intuitive principle for multimodal
  learning, i.e., the confidence should not increase when one modality is removed.
  Accordingly, we propose a novel regularization technique, i.e., Calibrating Multimodal
  Learning (CML) regularization, to calibrate the predictive confidence of previous
  methods. This technique could be flexibly equipped by existing models and improve
  the performance in terms of confidence calibration, classification accuracy, and
  model robustness.
