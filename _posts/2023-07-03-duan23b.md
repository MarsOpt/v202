title: Are Diffusion Models Vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks?
openreview: ZMDv1Mo89E
abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown great potential for image synthesis,
  but there is a lack of research on the security and privacy risks they may pose.
  In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of diffusion models to Membership
  Inference Attacks (MIAs), a common privacy concern. Our results indicate that existing
  MIAs designed for GANs or VAE are largely ineffective on diffusion models, either
  due to inapplicable scenarios (e.g., requiring the discriminator of GANs) or inappropriate
  assumptions (e.g., closer distances between synthetic samples and member samples).
  To address this gap, we propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI),
  a query-based MIA that infers memberships by assessing the matching of forward process
  posterior estimation at each timestep. SecMI follows the common overfitting assumption
  in MIA where member samples normally have smaller estimation errors, compared with
  hold-out samples. We consider both the standard diffusion models, e.g., DDPM, and
  the text-to-image diffusion models, e.g., Latent Diffusion Models and Stable Diffusion.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our methods precisely infer the membership
  with high confidence on both of the two scenarios across multiple different datasets.
