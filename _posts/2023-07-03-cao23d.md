title: One-sided Matrix Completion from Two Observations Per Row
openreview: H01CJWHAmw
abstract: Given only a few observed entries from a low-rank matrix $X$, matrix completion
  is the problem of imputing the missing entries, and it formalizes a wide range of
  real-world settings that involve estimating missing data. However, when there are
  too few observed entries to complete the matrix, what other aspects of the underlying
  matrix can be reliably recovered? We study one such problem setting, that of “one-sided”
  matrix completion, where our goal is to recover the right singular vectors of $X$,
  even in the regime where recovering the left singular vectors is impossible, which
  arises when there are more rows than columns and very few observations. We propose
  a natural algorithm that involves imputing the missing values of the matrix $X^TX$
  and show that even with only two observations per row in $X$, we can provably recover
  $X^TX$ as long as we have at least $\Omega(r^2 d \log d)$ rows, where $r$ is the
  rank and $d$ is the number of columns. We evaluate our algorithm on one-sided recovery
  of synthetic data and low-coverage genome sequencing. In these settings, our algorithm
  substantially outperforms standard matrix completion and a variety of direct factorization
  methods.
