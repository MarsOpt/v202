title: Structure Learning of Latent Factors via Clique Search on Correlation Thresholded
  Graphs
openreview: KVmFqS1cMP
abstract: 'Despite the widespread application of latent factor analysis, existing
  methods suffer from the following weaknesses: requiring the number of factors to
  be known, lack of theoretical guarantees for learning the model structure, and nonidentifiability
  of the parameters due to rotation invariance properties of the likelihood. We address
  these concerns by proposing a fast correlation thresholding (CT) algorithm that
  simultaneously learns the number of latent factors and a rotationally identifiable
  model structure. Our novel approach translates this structure learning problem into
  the search for so-called independent maximal cliques in a thresholded correlation
  graph that can be easily constructed from the observed data. Our clique analysis
  technique scales well up to thousands of variables, while competing methods are
  not applicable in a reasonable amount of running time. We establish a finite-sample
  error bound and high-dimensional consistency for the structure learning of our method.
  Through a series of simulation studies and a real data example, we show that the
  CT algorithm is an accurate method for learning the structure of factor analysis
  models and is robust to violations of its assumptions.'
