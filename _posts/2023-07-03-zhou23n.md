title: 'From Relational Pooling to Subgraph GNNs: A Universal Framework for More Expressive
  Graph Neural Networks'
openreview: K07XAlzh5i
abstract: Relational pooling is a framework for building more expressive and permutation-invariant
  graph neural networks. However, there is limited understanding of the exact enhancement
  in the expressivity of RP and its connection with the Weisfeiler-Lehman hierarchy.
  Starting from RP, we propose to explicitly assign labels to nodes as additional
  features to improve graph isomorphism distinguishing power of message passing neural
  networks. The method is then extended to higher-dimensional WL, leading to a novel
  $k,l$-WL algorithm, a more general framework than $k$-WL. We further introduce the
  subgraph concept into our hierarchy and propose a localized $k,l$-WL framework,
  incorporating a wide range of existing work, including many subgraph GNNs. Theoretically,
  we analyze the expressivity of $k,l$-WL w.r.t. $k$ and $l$ and compare it with the
  traditional $k$-WL. Complexity reduction methods are also systematically discussed
  to build powerful and practical $k,l$-GNN instances. We theoretically and experimentally
  prove that our method is universally compatible and capable of improving the expressivity
  of any base GNN model. Our $k,l$-GNNs achieve superior performance on many synthetic
  and real-world datasets, which verifies the effectiveness of our framework.
