title: Bi-directional Masks for Efficient N:M Sparse Training
openreview: 1SvVuUNN5I
abstract: 'We focus on addressing the dense backward propagation issue for training
  efficiency of N:M fine-grained sparsity that preserves at most N out of M consecutive
  weights and achieves practical speedups supported by the N:M sparse tensor core.
  Therefore, we present a novel method of Bi-directional Masks (Bi-Mask) with its
  two central innovations in: 1) Separate sparse masks in the two directions of forward
  and backward propagation to obtain training acceleration. It disentangles the forward
  and backward weight sparsity and overcomes the very dense gradient computation.
  2) An efficient weight row permutation method to maintain performance. It picks
  up the permutation candidate with the most eligible N:M weight blocks in the backward
  to minimize the gradient gap between traditional unidirectional masks and our bi-directional
  masks. Compared with existing uni-directional scenario that applies a transposable
  mask and enables backward acceleration, our Bi-Mask is experimentally demonstrated
  to be more superior in performance. Also, our Bi-Mask performs on par with or even
  better than methods that fail to achieve backward acceleration. Project of this
  paper is available at https://github.com/zyxxmu/Bi-Mask.'
