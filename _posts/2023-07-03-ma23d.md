title: Learning Signed Distance Functions from Noisy 3D Point Clouds via Noise to
  Noise Mapping
openreview: 2qflscc6A8
abstract: Learning signed distance functions (SDFs) from 3D point clouds is an important
  task in 3D computer vision. However, without ground truth signed distances, point
  normals or clean point clouds, current methods still struggle from learning SDFs
  from noisy point clouds. To overcome this challenge, we propose to learn SDFs via
  a noise to noise mapping, which does not require any clean point cloud or ground
  truth supervision for training. Our novelty lies in the noise to noise mapping which
  can infer a highly accurate SDF of a single object or scene from its multiple or
  even single noisy point cloud observations. Our novel learning manner is supported
  by modern Lidar systems which capture multiple noisy observations per second. We
  achieve this by a novel loss which enables statistical reasoning on point clouds
  and maintains geometric consistency although point clouds are irregular, unordered
  and have no point correspondence among noisy observations. Our evaluation under
  the widely used benchmarks demonstrates our superiority over the state-of-the-art
  methods in surface reconstruction, point cloud denoising and upsampling. Our code,
  data, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/mabaorui/Noise2NoiseMapping/
