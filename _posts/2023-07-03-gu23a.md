title: 'NerfDiff: Single-image View Synthesis with NeRF-guided Distillation from 3D-aware
  Diffusion'
openreview: cZZfXm6wZm
abstract: Novel view synthesis from a single image requires inferring occluded regions
  of objects and scenes whilst simultaneously maintaining semantic and physical consistency
  with the input. Existing approaches condition neural radiance fields (NeRF) on local
  image features, projecting points to the input image plane, and aggregating 2D features
  to perform volume rendering. However, under severe occlusion, this projection fails
  to resolve uncertainty, resulting in blurry renderings that lack details. In this
  work, we propose NerfDiff, which addresses this issue by distilling the knowledge
  of a 3D-aware conditional diffusion model (CDM) into NeRF through synthesizing and
  refining a set of virtual views at test-time. We further propose a novel NeRF-guided
  distillation algorithm that simultaneously generates 3D consistent virtual views
  from the CDM samples, and finetunes the NeRF based on the improved virtual views.
  Our approach significantly outperforms existing NeRF-based and geometry-free approaches
  on challenging datasets including ShapeNet, ABO, and Clevr3D.
