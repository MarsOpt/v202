title: Total Variation Graph Neural Networks
openreview: PRexNmId50
abstract: 'Recently proposed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for vertex clustering are
  trained with an unsupervised minimum cut objective, approximated by a Spectral Clustering
  (SC) relaxation. However, the SC relaxation is loose and, while it offers a closed-form
  solution, it also yields overly smooth cluster assignments that poorly separate
  the vertices. In this paper, we propose a GNN model that computes cluster assignments
  by optimizing a tighter relaxation of the minimum cut based on graph total variation
  (GTV). The cluster assignments can be used directly to perform vertex clustering
  or to implement graph pooling in a graph classification framework. Our model consists
  of two core components: i) a message-passing layer that minimizes the $\ell_1$ distance
  in the features of adjacent vertices, which is key to achieving sharp transitions
  between clusters; ii) an unsupervised loss function that minimizes the GTV of the
  cluster assignments while ensuring balanced partitions. Experimental results show
  that our model outperforms other GNNs for vertex clustering and graph classification.'
