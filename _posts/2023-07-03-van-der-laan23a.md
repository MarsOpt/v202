title: Causal Isotonic Calibration for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
openreview: nuHWrVbmus
abstract: We propose causal isotonic calibration, a novel nonparametric method for
  calibrating predictors of heterogeneous treatment effects. Furthermore, we introduce
  cross-calibration, a data-efficient variant of calibration that eliminates the need
  for hold-out calibration sets. Cross-calibration leverages cross-fitted predictors
  and generates a single calibrated predictor using all available data. Under weak
  conditions that do not assume monotonicity, we establish that both causal isotonic
  calibration and cross-calibration achieve fast doubly-robust calibration rates,
  as long as either the propensity score or outcome regression is estimated accurately
  in a suitable sense. The proposed causal isotonic calibrator can be wrapped around
  any black-box learning algorithm, providing robust and distribution-free calibration
  guarantees while preserving predictive performance.
