title: Meta Learning of Interface Conditions for Multi-Domain Physics-Informed Neural
  Networks
openreview: e694Xvz6Q6
abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are emerging as popular mesh-free
  solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). Recent extensions decompose the
  domain, apply different PINNs to solve the problem in each subdomain, and stitch
  the subdomains at the interface. Thereby, they can further alleviate the problem
  complexity, reduce the computational cost, and allow parallelization. However, the
  performance of multi-domain PINNs is sensitive to the choice of the interface conditions.
  While quite a few conditions have been proposed, there is no suggestion about how
  to select the conditions according to specific problems. To address this gap, we
  propose META Learning of Interface Conditions (METALIC), a simple, efficient yet
  powerful approach to dynamically determine appropriate interface conditions for
  solving a family of parametric PDEs. Specifically, we develop two contextual multi-arm
  bandit (MAB) models. The first one applies to the entire training course, and online
  updates a Gaussian process (GP) reward that given the PDE parameters and interface
  conditions predicts the performance. We prove a sub-linear regret bound for both
  UCB and Thompson sampling, which in theory guarantees the effectiveness of our MAB.
  The second one partitions the training into two stages, one is the stochastic phase
  and the other deterministic phase; we update a GP reward for each phase to enable
  different condition selections at the two stages to further bolster the flexibility
  and performance. We have shown the advantage of METALIC on four bench-mark PDE families.
