title: Unifying Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient Methods for Convex and Strongly Convex
  Objective Functions
openreview: LZvsnGH0eG
abstract: Although Nesterov’s accelerated gradient method (AGM) has been studied from
  various perspectives, it remains unclear why the most popular forms of AGMs must
  handle convex and strongly convex objective functions separately. To address this
  inconsistency, we propose a novel unified framework for Lagrangians, ordinary differential
  equation (ODE) models, and algorithms. As a special case, our new simple momentum
  algorithm, which we call the unified AGM, seamlessly bridges the gap between the
  two most popular forms of Nesterov’s AGM and has a superior convergence guarantee
  compared to existing algorithms for non-strongly convex objective functions. This
  property is beneficial in practice when considering ill-conditioned $\mu$-strongly
  convex objective functions (with small $\mu$). Furthermore, we generalize this algorithm
  and the corresponding ODE model to the higher-order non-Euclidean setting. Last
  but not least, our unified framework is used to construct the unified AGM-G ODE,
  a novel ODE model for minimizing the gradient norm of strongly convex functions.
