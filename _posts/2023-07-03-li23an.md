title: 'FedVS: Straggler-Resilient and Privacy-Preserving Vertical Federated Learning
  for Split Models'
openreview: 7aqVcrXjxa
abstract: 'In a vertical federated learning (VFL) system consisting of a central server
  and many distributed clients, the training data are vertically partitioned such
  that different features are privately stored on different clients. The problem of
  split VFL is to train a model split between the server and the clients. This paper
  aims to address two major challenges in split VFL: 1) performance degradation due
  to straggling clients during training; and 2) data and model privacy leakage from
  clients’ uploaded data embeddings. We propose FedVS to simultaneously address these
  two challenges. The key idea of FedVS is to design secret sharing schemes for the
  local data and models, such that information-theoretical privacy against colluding
  clients and curious server is guaranteed, and the aggregation of all clients’ embeddings
  is reconstructed losslessly, via decrypting computation shares from the non-straggling
  clients. Extensive experiments on various types of VFL datasets (including tabular,
  CV, and multi-view) demonstrate the universal advantages of FedVS in straggler mitigation
  and privacy protection over baseline protocols.'
