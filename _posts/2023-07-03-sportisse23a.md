title: Are labels informative in semi-supervised learning? Estimating and leveraging
  the missing-data mechanism.
openreview: nS2x7LOKZk
abstract: Semi-supervised learning is a powerful technique for leveraging unlabeled
  data to improve machine learning models, but it can be affected by the presence
  of â€œinformative" labels, which occur when some classes are more likely to be labeled
  than others. In the missing data literature, such labels are called missing not
  at random. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this issue by estimating
  the missing-data mechanism and using inverse propensity weighting to debias any
  SSL algorithm, including those using data augmentation. We also propose a likelihood
  ratio test to assess whether or not labels are indeed informative. Finally, we demonstrate
  the performance of the proposed methods on different datasets, in particular on
  two medical datasets for which we design pseudo-realistic missing data scenarios.
