title: 'QuantumDARTS: Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search for Variational Quantum
  Algorithms'
openreview: jGYxcXSg8C
abstract: With the arrival of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and
  the fast development of machine learning, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) including
  Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and quantum neural network (QNN) have received
  increasing attention with wide potential applications in foreseeable near future.
  We study the problem of quantum architecture search (QAS) for VQA to automatically
  design parameterized quantum circuits (PQC). We devise a differentiable searching
  algorithm based on Gumbel-Softmax in contrast to peer methods that often require
  numerous circuit sampling and evaluation. Two versions of our algorithm are provided,
  namely macro search and micro search, where macro search directly searches for the
  whole circuit like other literature while the innovative micro search is able to
  infer the sub-circuit structure from a small-scale and then transfer that to a large-scale
  problem. We conduct intensive experiments on unweighted Max-Cut, ground state energy
  estimation, and image classification. The superior performance shows the efficiency
  and capability of macro search, which requires little prior knowledge. Moreover,
  the experiments on micro search show the potential of our algorithm for large-scale
  QAS problems.
