title: 'RGE: A Repulsive Graph Rectification for Node Classification via Influence'
openreview: OcKwZhPwHA
abstract: In real-world graphs, noisy connections are inevitable, which makes it difficult
  to obtain unbiased node representations. Among various attempts to resolve this
  problem, a method of estimating the counterfactual effects of these connectivities
  has recently attracted attention, which mainly uses influence functions for single
  graph elements (i.e., node and edge). However, in this paper, we argue that there
  is a strongly interacting group effect between the influences of graph elements
  due to their connectivity. In the same vein, we observe that edge groups connecting
  to the same train node exhibit significant differences in their influences, hence
  no matter how negative each is, removing them at once may have a rather negative
  effect as a group. Based on this motivation, we propose a new edge-removing strategy,
  Repulsive edge Group Elimination (RGE), that preferentially removes edges with no
  interference in groups. Empirically, we demonstrate that RGE consistently outperforms
  existing methods on the various benchmark datasets.
