title: What can online reinforcement learning with function approximation benefit
  from general coverage conditions?
openreview: GRpbEbgAuD
abstract: In online reinforcement learning (RL), instead of employing standard structural
  assumptions on Markov decision processes (MDPs), using a certain coverage condition
  (original from offline RL) is enough to ensure sample-efficient guarantees (Xie
  et al. 2023). In this work, we focus on this new direction by digging more possible
  and general coverage conditions, and study the potential and the utility of them
  in efficient online RL. We identify more concepts, including the $L^p$ variant of
  concentrability, the density ratio realizability, and trade-off on the partial/rest
  coverage condition, that can be also beneficial to sample-efficient online RL, achieving
  improved regret bound. Furthermore, if exploratory offline data are used, under
  our coverage conditions, both statistically and computationally efficient guarantees
  can be achieved for online RL. Besides, even though the MDP structure is given,
  e.g., linear MDP, we elucidate that, good coverage conditions are still beneficial
  to obtain faster regret bound beyond $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ and even
  a logarithmic order regret. These results provide a good justification for the usage
  of general coverage conditions in efficient online RL.
