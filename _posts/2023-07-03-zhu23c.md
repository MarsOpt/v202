title: Mixture Proportion Estimation Beyond Irreducibility
openreview: IKnlPxKi7i
abstract: The task of mixture proportion estimation (MPE) is to estimate the weight
  of a component distribution in a mixture, given observations from both the component
  and mixture. Previous work on MPE adopts the <em>irreducibility</em> assumption,
  which ensures identifiablity of the mixture proportion. In this paper, we propose
  a more general sufficient condition that accommodates several settings of interest
  where irreducibility does not hold. We further present a resampling-based meta-algorithm
  that takes any existing MPE algorithm designed to work under irreducibility and
  adapts it to work under our more general condition. Our approach empirically exhibits
  improved estimation performance relative to baseline methods and to a recently proposed
  regrouping-based algorithm.
