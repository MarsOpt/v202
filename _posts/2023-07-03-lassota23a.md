title: Minimalistic Predictions to Schedule Jobs with Online Precedence Constraints
openreview: mMFGR79jfK
abstract: 'We consider non-clairvoyant scheduling with online precedence constraints,
  where an algorithm is oblivious to any job dependencies and learns about a job only
  if all of its predecessors have been completed. Given strong impossibility results
  in classical competitive analysis, we investigate the problem in a learning-augmented
  setting, where an algorithm has access to predictions without any quality guarantee.
  We discuss different prediction models: novel problem-specific models as well as
  general ones, which have been proposed in previous works. We present lower bounds
  and algorithmic upper bounds for different precedence topologies, and thereby give
  a structured overview on which and how additional (possibly erroneous) information
  helps for designing better algorithms. Along the way, we also improve bounds on
  traditional competitive ratios for existing algorithms.'
