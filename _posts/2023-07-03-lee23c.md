title: 'InGram: Inductive Knowledge Graph Embedding via Relation Graphs'
openreview: OoOpO0u4Xd
abstract: Inductive knowledge graph completion has been considered as the task of
  predicting missing triplets between new entities that are not observed during training.
  While most inductive knowledge graph completion methods assume that all entities
  can be new, they do not allow new relations to appear at inference time. This restriction
  prohibits the existing methods from appropriately handling real-world knowledge
  graphs where new entities accompany new relations. In this paper, we propose an
  INductive knowledge GRAph eMbedding method, InGram, that can generate embeddings
  of new relations as well as new entities at inference time. Given a knowledge graph,
  we define a relation graph as a weighted graph consisting of relations and the affinity
  weights between them. Based on the relation graph and the original knowledge graph,
  InGram learns how to aggregate neighboring embeddings to generate relation and entity
  embeddings using an attention mechanism. Experimental results show that InGram outperforms
  14 different state-of-the-art methods on varied inductive learning scenarios.
