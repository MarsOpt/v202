title: 'GRAFENNE: Learning on Graphs with Heterogeneous and Dynamic Feature Sets'
openreview: pNi4q28UyI
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs), in general, are built on the assumption of
  a static set of features characterizing each node in a graph. This assumption is
  often violated in practice. Existing methods partly address this issue through feature
  imputation. However, these techniques (i) assume uniformity of feature set across
  nodes, (ii) are transductive by nature, and (iii) fail to work when features are
  added or removed over time. In this work, we address these limitations through a
  novel GNN framework called GRAFENNE. GRAFENNE performs a novel allotropic transformation
  on the original graph, wherein the nodes and features are decoupled through a bipartite
  encoding. Through a carefully chosen message passing framework on the allotropic
  transformation, we make the model parameter size independent of the number of features
  and thereby inductive to both unseen nodes and features. We prove that GRAFENNE
  is at least as expressive as any of the existing message-passing GNNs in terms of
  Weisfeiler-Leman tests, and therefore, the additional inductivity to unseen features
  does not come at the cost of expressivity. In addition, as demonstrated over four
  real-world graphs, GRAFENNE empowers the underlying GNN with high empirical efficacy
  and the ability to learn in continual fashion over streaming feature sets.
