title: A theory of continuous generative flow networks
openreview: CjKL4iGSWl
abstract: Generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are amortized variational inference
  algorithms that are trained to sample from unnormalized target distributions over
  compositional objects. A key limitation of GFlowNets until this time has been that
  they are restricted to discrete spaces. We present a theory for generalized GFlowNets,
  which encompasses both existing discrete GFlowNets and ones with continuous or hybrid
  state spaces, and perform experiments with two goals in mind. First, we illustrate
  critical points of the theory and the importance of various assumptions. Second,
  we empirically demonstrate how observations about discrete GFlowNets transfer to
  the continuous case and show strong results compared to non-GFlowNet baselines on
  several previously studied tasks. This work greatly widens the perspectives for
  the application of GFlowNets in probabilistic inference and various modeling settings.
