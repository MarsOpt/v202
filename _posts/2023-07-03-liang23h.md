title: 'CLUSTSEG: Clustering for Universal Segmentation'
openreview: XFrlF5xDyb
abstract: 'We present CLUSTSEG, a general, transformer-based framework that tackles
  different image segmentation tasks ($i.e.,$ superpixel, semantic, instance, and
  panoptic) through a unified, neural clustering scheme. Regarding queries as cluster
  centers, CLUSTSEG is innovative in two aspects: 1) cluster centers are initialized
  in heterogeneous ways so as to pointedly address task-specific demands ($e.g.,$
  instance- or category-level distinctiveness), yet without modifying the architecture;
  and 2) pixel-cluster assignment, formalized in a cross-attention fashion, is alternated
  with cluster center update, yet without learning additional parameters. These innovations
  closely link CLUSTSEG to EM clustering and make it a transparent and powerful framework
  that yields superior results across the above segmentation tasks.'
