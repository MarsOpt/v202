title: Speeding Up Bellman Ford via Minimum Violation Permutations
openreview: mrykt39VUw
abstract: The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a basic primitive for computing single source
  shortest paths in graphs with negative weight edges. Its running time is governed
  by the order the algorithm examines vertices for iterative updates on the value
  of their shortest path. In this work we study this problem through the lens of ’Algorithms
  with predictions,’ and show how to leverage auxiliary information from similar instances
  to improve the running time. We do this by identifying the key problem of Minimum
  Violation Permutations, and give algorithms with strong approximation guarantees
  as well as formal lower bounds. We complement the theoretical analysis with an empirical
  evaluation, showing that this approach can lead to a significant speed up in practice.
