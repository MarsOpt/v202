title: Secure Federated Correlation Test and Entropy Estimation
openreview: ICk7GJ1awE
abstract: We propose the first federated correlation test framework compatible with
  secure aggregation, namely FED-$\chi^2$. In our protocol, the statistical computations
  are recast as frequency moment estimation problems, where the clients collaboratively
  generate a shared projection matrix and then use stable projection to encode the
  local information in a compact vector. As such encodings can be linearly aggregated,
  secure aggregation can be applied to conceal the individual updates. We formally
  establish the security guarantee of FED-$\chi^2$ by proving that only the minimum
  necessary information (i.e., the correlation statistics) is revealed to the server.
  We show that our protocol can be naturally extended to estimate other statistics
  that can be recast as frequency moment estimations. By accommodating Shannonâ€™e Entropy
  in FED-$\chi^2$, we further propose the first secure federated entropy estimation
  protocol, FED-$H$. The evaluation results demonstrate that FED-$\chi^2$ and FED-$H$
  achieve good performance with small client-side computation overhead in several
  real-world case studies.
