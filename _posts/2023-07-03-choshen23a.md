title: 'ContraBAR: Contrastive Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL'
openreview: EHgAM1xnWv
abstract: In meta reinforcement learning (meta RL), an agent seeks a Bayes-optimal
  policy â€“ the optimal policy when facing an unknown task that is sampled from some
  known task distribution. Previous approaches tackled this problem by inferring a
  $\textit{belief}$ over task parameters, using variational inference methods. Motivated
  by recent successes of contrastive learning approaches in RL, such as contrastive
  predictive coding (CPC), we investigate whether contrastive methods can be used
  for learning Bayes-optimal behavior. We begin by proving that representations learned
  by CPC are indeed sufficient for Bayes optimality. Based on this observation, we
  propose a simple meta RL algorithm that uses CPC in lieu of variational belief inference.
  Our method, $\textit{ContraBAR}$, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art
  in domains with state-based observation and circumvents the computational toll of
  future observation reconstruction, enabling learning in domains with image-based
  observations. It can also be combined with image augmentations for domain randomization
  and used seamlessly in both online and offline meta RL settings.
