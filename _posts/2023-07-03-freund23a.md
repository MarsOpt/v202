title: A Coupled Flow Approach to Imitation Learning
openreview: laR6abCxIu
abstract: In reinforcement learning and imitation learning, an object of central importance
  is the state distribution induced by the policy. It plays a crucial role in the
  policy gradient theorem, and references to it–along with the related state-action
  distribution–can be found all across the literature. Despite its importance, the
  state distribution is mostly discussed indirectly and theoretically, rather than
  being modeled explicitly. The reason being an absence of appropriate density estimation
  tools. In this work, we investigate applications of a normalizing flow based model
  for the aforementioned distributions. In particular, we use a pair of flows coupled
  through the optimality point of the Donsker-Varadhan representation of the Kullback-Leibler
  (KL) divergence, for distribution matching based imitation learning. Our algorithm,
  Coupled Flow Imitation Learning (CFIL), achieves state-of-the-art performance on
  benchmark tasks with a single expert trajectory and extends naturally to a variety
  of other settings, including the subsampled and state-only regimes.
