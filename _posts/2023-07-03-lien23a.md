title: Revisiting Domain Randomization via Relaxed State-Adversarial Policy Optimization
openreview: tIlCpCRyvM
abstract: Domain randomization (DR) is widely used in reinforcement learning (RL)
  to bridge the gap between simulation and reality by maximizing its average returns
  under the perturbation of environmental parameters. However, even the most complex
  simulators cannot capture all details in reality due to finite domain parameters
  and simplified physical models. Additionally, the existing methods often assume
  that the distribution of domain parameters belongs to a specific family of probability
  functions, such as normal distributions, which may not be correct. To overcome these
  limitations, we propose a new approach to DR by rethinking it from the perspective
  of adversarial state perturbation, without the need for reconfiguring the simulator
  or relying on prior knowledge about the environment. We also address the issue of
  over-conservatism that can occur when perturbing agents to the worst states during
  training by introducing a Relaxed State-Adversarial Algorithm that simultaneously
  maximizes the average-case and worst-case returns. We evaluate our method by comparing
  it to state-of-the-art methods, providing experimental results and theoretical proofs
  to verify its effectiveness. Our source code and appendix are available at https://github.com/sophialien/RAPPO.
