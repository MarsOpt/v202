title: Active Ranking of Experts Based on their Performances in Many Tasks
openreview: fmLW8Eq3VQ
abstract: We consider the problem of ranking n experts based on their performances
  on d tasks. We make a monotonicity assumption stating that for each pair of experts,
  one outperforms the other on all tasks. We consider the sequential setting where
  in each round the learner has access to noisy evaluations of actively chosen pair
  of expert-task, given the information available up to the actual round. Given a
  confidence parameter $\delta \in (0, 1)$, we provide strategies allowing to recover
  the correct ranking of experts and develop a bound on the total number of queries
  made by our algorithm that hold with probability at least $1-\delta$. We show that
  our strategy is adaptive to the complexity of the problem (our bounds are instance
  dependent), and develop matching lower bounds up to a ploy-logarithmic factor. Finally,
  we adapt our strategy to the relaxed problem of best expert identification and provide
  numerical simulation consistent with our theoretical results
