title: Effective Neural Topic Modeling with Embedding Clustering Regularization
openreview: 6uM4yf6D5l
abstract: 'Topic models have been prevalent for decades with various applications.
  However, existing topic models commonly suffer from the notorious topic collapsing:
  discovered topics semantically collapse towards each other, leading to highly repetitive
  topics, insufficient topic discovery, and damaged model interpretability. In this
  paper, we propose a new neural topic model, Embedding Clustering Regularization
  Topic Model (ECRTM). Besides the existing reconstruction error, we propose a novel
  Embedding Clustering Regularization (ECR), which forces each topic embedding to
  be the center of a separately aggregated word embedding cluster in the semantic
  space. This enables each produced topic to contain distinct word semantics, which
  alleviates topic collapsing. Regularized by ECR, our ECRTM generates diverse and
  coherent topics together with high-quality topic distributions of documents. Extensive
  experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ECRTM effectively addresses the
  topic collapsing issue and consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in
  terms of topic quality, topic distributions of documents, and downstream classification
  tasks.'
