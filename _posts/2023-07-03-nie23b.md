title: A Framework for Adapting Offline Algorithms to Solve Combinatorial Multi-Armed
  Bandit Problems with Bandit Feedback
openreview: fBDP40MrQS
abstract: We investigate the problem of stochastic, combinatorial multi-armed bandits
  where the learner only has access to bandit feedback and the reward function can
  be non-linear. We provide a general framework for adapting discrete offline approximation
  algorithms into sublinear $\alpha$-regret methods that only require bandit feedback,
  achieving $\mathcal{O}\left(T^\frac{2}{3}\log(T)^\frac{1}{3}\right)$ expected cumulative
  $\alpha$-regret dependence on the horizon $T$. The framework only requires the offline
  algorithms to be robust to small errors in function evaluation. The adaptation procedure
  does not even require explicit knowledge of the offline approximation algorithm
  â€” the offline algorithm can be used as black box subroutine. To demonstrate the
  utility of the proposed framework, the proposed framework is applied to multiple
  problems in submodular maximization, adapting approximation algorithms for cardinality
  and for knapsack constraints. The new CMAB algorithms for knapsack constraints outperform
  a full-bandit method developed for the adversarial setting in experiments with real-world
  data.
