title: 'The Monge Gap: A Regularizer to Learn All Transport Maps'
openreview: U1KcX2JWjF
abstract: 'Optimal transport (OT) theory has been used in machine learning to study
  and characterize maps that can push-forward efficiently a probability measure onto
  another. Recent works have drawn inspiration from Brenier’s theorem, which states
  that when the ground cost is the squared-Euclidean distance, the “best” map to morph
  a continuous measure in $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ into another must be the gradient
  of a convex function. To exploit that result, Makkuva et. al (2020); Korotin et.
  al (2020) consider maps $T=\nabla f_\theta$, where $f_\theta$ is an input convex
  neural network (ICNN), as defined by Amos et. al (2017), and fit $\theta$ with SGD
  using samples. Despite their mathematical elegance, fitting OT maps with ICNNs raises
  many challenges, due notably to the many constraints imposed on $\theta$; the need
  to approximate the conjugate of $f_\theta$; or the limitation that they only work
  for the squared-Euclidean cost. More generally, we question the relevance of using
  Brenier’s result, which only applies to densities, to constrain the architecture
  of candidate maps fitted on samples. Motivated by these limitations, we propose
  a radically different approach to estimating OT maps: Given a cost $c$ and a reference
  measure $\rho$, we introduce a regularizer, the Monge gap $\mathcal{M}^c_{\rho}(T)$
  of a map $T$. That gap quantifies how far a map $T$ deviates from the ideal properties
  we expect from a $c$-OT map. In practice, we drop all architecture requirements
  for $T$ and simply minimize a distance (e.g., the Sinkhorn divergence) between $T\sharp\mu$
  and $\nu$, regularized by $\mathcal{M}^c_\rho(T)$. We study $\mathcal{M}^c_{\rho}$
  and show how our simple pipeline significantly outperforms other baselines in practice.'
