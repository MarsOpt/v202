title: Sequential Underspecified Instrument Selection for Cause-Effect Estimation
openreview: dT7uMuZJjf
abstract: 'Instrumental variable (IV) methods are used to estimate causal effects
  in settings with unobserved confounding, where we cannot directly experiment on
  the treatment variable. Instruments are variables which only affect the outcome
  indirectly via the treatment variable(s). Most IV applications focus on low-dimensional
  treatments and crucially require at least as many instruments as treatments. This
  assumption is restrictive: in the natural sciences we often seek to infer causal
  effects of high-dimensional treatments (e.g., the effect of gene expressions or
  microbiota on health and disease), but can only run few experiments with a limited
  number of instruments (e.g., drugs or antibiotics). In such under-specified problems,
  the full treatment effect is not identifiable in a single experiment even in the
  linear case. We show that one can still reliably recover the projection of the treatment
  effect onto the instrumented subspace and develop techniques to consistently combine
  such partial estimates from different sets of instruments. We then leverage our
  combined estimators in an algorithm that iteratively proposes the most informative
  instruments at each round of experimentation to maximize the overall information
  about the full causal effect.'
