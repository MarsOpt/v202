title: Adversarial Collaborative Learning on Non-IID Features
openreview: DVF7gEQQf7
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) has been a popular approach to enable collaborative
  learning on multiple parties without exchanging raw data. However, the model performance
  of FL may degrade a lot due to non-IID data. While many FL algorithms focus on non-IID
  labels, FL on non-IID features has largely been overlooked. Different from typical
  FL approaches, the paper proposes a new learning concept called ADCOL (Adversarial
  Collaborative Learning) for non-IID features. Instead of adopting the widely used
  model-averaging scheme, ADCOL conducts training in an adversarial way: the server
  aims to train a discriminator to distinguish the representations of the parties,
  while the parties aim to generate a common representation distribution. Our experiments
  show that ADCOL achieves better performance than state-of-the-art FL algorithms
  on non-IID features.'
