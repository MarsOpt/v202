title: Tight Data Access Bounds for Private Top-$k$ Selection
openreview: vZh3aw4TaF
abstract: 'We study the top-$k$ selection problem under the differential privacy model:
  $m$ items are rated according to votes of a set of clients. We consider a setting
  in which algorithms can retrieve data via a sequence of accesses, each either a
  random access or a sorted access; the goal is to minimize the total number of data
  accesses. Our algorithm requires only $O(\sqrt{mk})$ expected accesses: to our knowledge,
  this is the first sublinear data-access upper bound for this problem. Our analysis
  also shows that the well-known exponential mechanism requires only $O(\sqrt{m})$
  expected accesses. Accompanying this, we develop the first lower bounds for the
  problem, in three settings: only random accesses; only sorted accesses; a sequence
  of accesses of either kind. We show that, to avoid $\Omega(m)$ access cost, supporting
  <em>both</em> kinds of access is necessary, and that in this case our algorithmâ€™s
  access cost is optimal.'
