title: Demystifying Uneven Vulnerability of Link Stealing Attacks against Graph Neural
  Networks
openreview: FQzJ3zBYLO
abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) dominate the state-of-the-art for exploring
  graphs in real-world applications, they have been shown to be vulnerable to a growing
  number of privacy attacks. For instance, link stealing is a well-known membership
  inference attack (MIA) on edges that infers the presence of an edge in a GNNâ€™s training
  graph. Recent studies on independent and identically distributed data (e.g., images)
  have empirically demonstrated that individuals from different groups suffer from
  different levels of privacy risks to MIAs, i.e., uneven vulnerability. However,
  theoretical evidence of such uneven vulnerability is missing. In this paper, we
  first present theoretical evidence of the uneven vulnerability of GNNs to link stealing
  attacks, which lays the foundation for demystifying such uneven risks among different
  groups of edges. We further demonstrate a group-based attack paradigm to expose
  the practical privacy harm to GNN users derived from the uneven vulnerability of
  edges. Finally, we empirically validate the existence of obvious uneven vulnerability
  on nine real-world datasets (e.g., about 25% AUC difference between different groups
  in the Credit graph). Compared with existing methods, the outperformance of our
  group-based attack paradigm confirms that customising different strategies for different
  groups results in more effective privacy attacks.
