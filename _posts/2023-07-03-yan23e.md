title: Quantum 3D Graph Learning with Applications to Molecule Embedding
openreview: mLOWz0e1Yq
abstract: Learning 3D graph with spatial position as well as node attributes has been
  recently actively studied, for its utility in different applications e.g. 3D molecules.
  Quantum computing is known a promising direction for its potential theoretical supremacy
  for large-scale graph and combinatorial problem as well as the increasing evidence
  for the availability to physical quantum devices in the near term. In this paper,
  for the first time to our best knowledge, we propose a quantum 3D embedding ansatz
  that learns the latent representation of 3D structures from the Hilbert space composed
  of the Bloch sphere of each qubit. Specifically, the 3D Cartesian coordinates of
  nodes are converted into rotation and torsion angles and then encode them into the
  form of qubits. Moreover, Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) is applied to serve
  as the trainable layers and the output of the PQC is adopted as the final node embedding.
  Experimental results on two downstream tasks, molecular property prediction and
  3D molecular geometries generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.
  We show the capacity and capability of our model with the evaluation on the QM9
  dataset (134k molecules) with very few parameters, and its potential to be executed
  on a real quantum device.
