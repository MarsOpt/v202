title: Nonparametric Generative Modeling with Conditional Sliced-Wasserstein Flows
openreview: cOngPVufCF
abstract: Sliced-Wasserstein Flow (SWF) is a promising approach to nonparametric generative
  modeling but has not been widely adopted due to its suboptimal generative quality
  and lack of conditional modeling capabilities. In this work, we make two major contributions
  to bridging this gap. First, based on a pleasant observation that (under certain
  conditions) the SWF of joint distributions coincides with those of conditional distributions,
  we propose Conditional Sliced-Wasserstein Flow (CSWF), a simple yet effective extension
  of SWF that enables nonparametric conditional modeling. Second, we introduce appropriate
  inductive biases of images into SWF with two techniques inspired by local connectivity
  and multiscale representation in vision research, which greatly improve the efficiency
  and quality of modeling images. With all the improvements, we achieve generative
  performance comparable with many deep parametric generative models on both conditional
  and unconditional tasks in a purely nonparametric fashion, demonstrating its great
  potential.
