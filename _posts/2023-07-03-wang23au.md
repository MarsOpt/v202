title: Offline Meta Reinforcement Learning with In-Distribution Online Adaptation
openreview: dkYfm01yQp
abstract: 'Recent offline meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) methods typically
  utilize task-dependent behavior policies (e.g., training RL agents on each individual
  task) to collect a multi-task dataset. However, these methods always require extra
  information for fast adaptation, such as offline context for testing tasks. To address
  this problem, we first formally characterize a unique challenge in offline meta-RL:
  transition-reward distribution shift between offline datasets and online adaptation.
  Our theory finds that out-of-distribution adaptation episodes may lead to unreliable
  policy evaluation and that online adaptation with in-distribution episodes can ensure
  adaptation performance guarantee. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose
  a novel adaptation framework, called In-Distribution online Adaptation with uncertainty
  Quantification (IDAQ), which generates in-distribution context using a given uncertainty
  quantification and performs effective task belief inference to address new tasks.
  We find a return-based uncertainty quantification for IDAQ that performs effectively.
  Experiments show that IDAQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Meta-World
  ML1 benchmark compared to baselines with/without offline adaptation.'
