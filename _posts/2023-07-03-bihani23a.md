title: 'StriderNet: A Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimize Atomic Structures
  on Rough Energy Landscapes'
openreview: 6vauERTFMb
abstract: Optimization of atomic structures presents a challenging problem, due to
  their highly rough and non-convex energy landscape, with wide applications in the
  fields of drug design, materials discovery, and mechanics. Here, we present a graph
  reinforcement learning approach, StriderNet, that learns a policy to displace the
  atoms towards low energy configurations. We evaluate the performance of StriderNet
  on three complex atomic systems, namely, binary Lennard-Jones particles, calcium
  silicate hydrates gel, and disordered silicon. We show that StriderNet outperforms
  all classical optimization algorithms and enables the discovery of a lower energy
  minimum. In addition, StriderNet exhibits a higher rate of reaching minima with
  energies, as confirmed by the average over multiple realizations. Finally, we show
  that StriderNet exhibits inductivity to unseen system sizes that are an order of
  magnitude different from the training system. All the codes and datasets are available
  at https://github.com/M3RG-IITD/StriderNET.
