title: Variational Autoencoding Neural Operators
openreview: gpbBUE8uhp
abstract: Unsupervised learning with functional data is an emerging paradigm of machine
  learning research with applications to computer vision, climate modeling and physical
  systems. A natural way of modeling functional data is by learning operators between
  infinite dimensional spaces, leading to discretization invariant representations
  that scale independently of the sample grid resolution. Here we present Variational
  Autoencoding Neural Operators (VANO), a general strategy for making a large class
  of operator learning architectures act as variational autoencoders. For this purpose,
  we provide a novel rigorous mathematical formulation of the variational objective
  in function spaces for training. VANO first maps an input function to a distribution
  over a latent space using a parametric encoder and then decodes a sample from the
  latent distribution to reconstruct the input, as in classic variational autoencoders.
  We test VANO with different model set-ups and architecture choices for a variety
  of benchmarks. We start from a simple Gaussian random field where we can analytically
  track what the model learns and progressively transition to more challenging benchmarks
  including modeling phase separation in Cahn-Hilliard systems and real world satellite
  data for measuring Earth surface deformation.
