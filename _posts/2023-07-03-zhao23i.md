title: Protecting Language Generation Models via Invisible Watermarking
openreview: dfLRMF5Hss
abstract: Language generation models have been an increasingly powerful enabler to
  many applications. Many such models offer free or affordable API access which makes
  them potentially vulnerable to model extraction attacks through distillation. To
  protect intellectual property (IP) and make fair use of these models, various techniques
  such as lexical watermarking and synonym replacement have been proposed. However,
  these methods can be nullified by obvious countermeasures such as “synonym randomization”.
  To address this issue, we propose GINSW, a novel method to protect text generation
  models from being stolen through distillation. The key idea of our method is to
  inject secret signals into the probability vector of the decoding steps for each
  target token. We can then detect the secret message by probing a suspect model to
  tell if it is distilled from the protected one. Experimental results show that GINSW
  can effectively identify instances of IP infringement with minimal impact on the
  generation quality of protected APIs. Our method demonstrates an absolute improvement
  of 19 to 29 points on mean average precision (mAP) in detecting suspects compared
  to previous methods against watermark removal attacks.
