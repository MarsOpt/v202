title: 'ModelDiff: A Framework for Comparing Learning Algorithms'
openreview: jIMwqkngZQ
abstract: We study the problem of (learning) algorithm comparison, where the goal
  is to find differences between models trained with two different learning algorithms.
  We begin by formalizing this goal as one of finding distinguishing feature transformations,
  i.e., input transformations that change the predictions of models trained with one
  learning algorithm but not the other. We then present ModelDiff, a method that leverages
  the datamodels framework (Ilyas et al., 2022) to compare learning algorithms based
  on how they use their training data. We demonstrate ModelDiff through three case
  studies, comparing models trained with/without data augmentation, with/without pre-training,
  and with different SGD hyperparameters.
