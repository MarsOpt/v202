title: Fair yet Asymptotically Equal Collaborative Learning
openreview: 5VhltFPSO8
abstract: 'In collaborative learning with streaming data, nodes (e.g., organizations)
  jointly and continuously learn a machine learning (ML) model by sharing the latest
  model updates computed from their latest streaming data. For the more resourceful
  nodes to be willing to share their model updates, they need to be fairly incentivized.
  This paper explores an incentive design that guarantees fairness so that nodes receive
  rewards commensurate to their contributions. Our approach leverages an explore-then-exploit
  formulation to estimate the nodes’ contributions (i.e., exploration) for realizing
  our theoretically guaranteed fair incentives (i.e., exploitation). However, we observe
  a "rich get richer" phenomenon arising from the existing approaches to guarantee
  fairness and it discourages the participation of the less resourceful nodes. To
  remedy this, we additionally preserve asymptotic equality, i.e., less resourceful
  nodes achieve equal performance eventually to the more resourceful/“rich” nodes.
  We empirically demonstrate in two settings with real-world streaming data: federated
  online incremental learning and federated reinforcement learning, that our proposed
  approach outperforms existing baselines in fairness and learning performance while
  remaining competitive in preserving equality.'
