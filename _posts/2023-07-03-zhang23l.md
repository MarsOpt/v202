title: Crafting Training Degradation Distribution for the Accuracy-Generalization
  Trade-off in Real-World Super-Resolution
openreview: TcMIK8Wx6e
abstract: 'Super-resolution (SR) techniques designed for real-world applications commonly
  encounter two primary challenges: generalization performance and restoration accuracy.
  We demonstrate that when methods are trained using complex, large-range degradations
  to enhance generalization, a decline in accuracy is inevitable. However, since the
  degradation in a certain real-world applications typically exhibits a limited variation
  range, it becomes feasible to strike a trade-off between generalization performance
  and testing accuracy within this scope. In this work, we introduce a novel approach
  to craft training degradation distributions using a small set of reference images.
  Our strategy is founded upon the binned representation of the degradation space
  and the Frechet distance between degradation distributions. Our results indicate
  that the proposed technique significantly improves the performance of test images
  while preserving generalization capabilities in real-world applications.'
