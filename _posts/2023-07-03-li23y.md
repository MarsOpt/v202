title: On the Initialization of Graph Neural Networks
openreview: 2t0I8KYaPG
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have displayed considerable promise in graph
  representation learning across various applications. The core learning process requires
  the initialization of model weight matrices within each GNN layer, which is typically
  accomplished via classic initialization methods such as Xavier initialization. However,
  these methods were originally motivated to stabilize the variance of hidden embeddings
  and gradients across layers of Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Convolutional
  Neural Networks (CNNs) to avoid vanishing gradients and maintain steady information
  flow. In contrast, within the GNN context classical initializations disregard the
  impact of the input graph structure and message passing on variance. In this paper,
  we analyze the variance of forward and backward propagation across GNN layers and
  show that the variance instability of GNN initializations comes from the combined
  effect of the activation function, hidden dimension, graph structure and message
  passing. To better account for these influence factors, we propose a new initialization
  method for Variance Instability Reduction within GNN Optimization (Virgo), which
  naturally tends to equate forward and backward variances across successive layers.
  We conduct comprehensive experiments on 15 datasets to show that Virgo can lead
  to superior model performance and more stable variance at initialization on node
  classification, link prediction and graph classification tasks.
