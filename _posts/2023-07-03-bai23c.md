title: Linear optimal partial transport embedding
openreview: ftLm9QAqwc
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has gained popularity due to its various applications
  in fields such as machine learning, statistics, and signal processing. However,
  the balanced mass requirement limits its performance in practical problems. To address
  these limitations, variants of the OT problem, including unbalanced OT, Optimal
  partial transport (OPT), and Hellinger Kantorovich (HK), have been proposed. In
  this paper, we propose the Linear optimal partial transport (LOPT) embedding, which
  extends the (local) linearization technique on OT and HK to the OPT problem. The
  proposed embedding allows for faster computation of OPT distance between pairs of
  positive measures. Besides our theoretical contributions, we demonstrate the LOPT
  embedding technique in point-cloud interpolation and PCA analysis. Our code is available
  at https://github.com/Baio0/LinearOPT.
