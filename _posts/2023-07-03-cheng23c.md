title: Identification of the Adversary from a Single Adversarial Example
openreview: HBrQI0tX8F
abstract: 'Deep neural networks have been shown vulnerable to adversarial examples.
  Even though many defense methods have been proposed to enhance the robustness, it
  is still a long way toward providing an attack-free method to build a trustworthy
  machine learning system. In this paper, instead of enhancing the robustness, we
  take the investigator’s perspective and propose a new framework to trace the first
  compromised model copy in a forensic investigation manner. Specifically, we focus
  on the following setting: the machine learning service provider provides model copies
  for a set of customers. However, one of the customers conducted adversarial attacks
  to fool the system. Therefore, the investigator’s objective is to identify the first
  compromised copy by collecting and analyzing evidence from only available adversarial
  examples. To make the tracing viable, we design a random mask watermarking mechanism
  to differentiate adversarial examples from different copies. First, we propose a
  tracing approach in the data-limited case where the original example is also available.
  Then, we design a data-free approach to identify the adversary without accessing
  the original example. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed framework is evaluated
  by extensive experiments with different model architectures, adversarial attacks,
  and datasets.'
