title: Quantum Lower Bounds for Finding Stationary Points of Nonconvex Functions
openreview: lV7YIPL95i
abstract: 'Quantum computing is an emerging technology that has been rapidly advancing
  in the past decades. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of quantum lower
  bounds on finding $\epsilon$-approximate stationary points of nonconvex functions,
  and we consider the following two important settings: 1) having access to $p$-th
  order derivatives; or 2) having access to stochastic gradients. The classical query
  lower bounds are $\Omega\big(\epsilon^{-\frac{1+p}{p}}\big)$ regarding the first
  setting and $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ regarding the second setting (or $\Omega(\epsilon^{-3})$
  if the stochastic gradient function is mean-squared smooth). In this paper, we extend
  all these classical lower bounds to the quantum setting. They match the classical
  algorithmic results respectively, demonstrating that there is no quantum speedup
  for finding $\epsilon$-stationary points of nonconvex functions with $p$-th order
  derivative inputs or stochastic gradient inputs, whether with or without the mean-squared
  smoothness assumption. Technically, we prove our quantum lower bounds by showing
  that the sequential nature of classical hard instances in all these settings also
  applies to quantum queries, preventing any quantum speedup other than revealing
  information of the stationary points sequentially.'
