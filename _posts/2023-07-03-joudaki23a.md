title: On Bridging the Gap between Mean Field and Finite Width Deep Random Multilayer
  Perceptron with Batch Normalization
openreview: c9prgxA903
abstract: Mean-field theory is widely used in theoretical studies of neural networks.
  In this paper, we analyze the role of depth in the concentration of mean-field predictions
  for Gram matrices of hidden representations in deep multilayer perceptron (MLP)
  with batch normalization (BN) at initialization. It is postulated that the mean-field
  predictions suffer from layer-wise errors that amplify with depth. We demonstrate
  that BN avoids this error amplification with depth. When the chain of hidden representations
  is rapidly mixing, we establish a concentration bound for a mean-field model of
  Gram matrices. To our knowledge, this is the first concentration bound that does
  not become vacuous with depth for standard MLPs with a finite width.
