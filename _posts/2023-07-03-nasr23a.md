title: Effectively Using Public Data in Privacy Preserving Machine Learning
openreview: smrYWkIV9J
abstract: 'Differentially private (DP) machine learning techniques are notorious for
  their degradation of model utility (e.g., they degrade classification accuracy).
  A recent line of work has demonstrated that leveraging <em>public data</em> can
  improve the trade-off between privacy and utility when training models with DP guaranteed.
  In this work, we further explore the potential of using public data in DP models,
  showing that utility gains can in fact be significantly higher than what shown in
  prior works. Specifically, we introduce DOPE-SGD, a modified DP-SGD algorithm that
  leverages public data during its training. DOPE-SGD uses public data in two complementary
  ways: (1) it uses advance augmentation techniques that leverages public data to
  generate synthetic data that is effectively embedded in multiple steps of the training
  pipeline; (2) it uses a modified gradient clipping mechanism (which is a standard
  technique in DP training) to change the <em>origin</em> of gradient vectors using
  the information inferred from available public and synthetic data, therefore boosting
  utility. We also introduce a technique to ensemble intermediate DP models by leveraging
  the post processing property of differential privacy to further improve the accuracy
  of the predictions. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach in improving the state-of-the-art in DP machine learning across multiple
  datasets, network architectures, and application domains. For instance, assuming
  access to $2,000$ public images, and for a privacy budget of $\varepsilon=2,\delta=10^{-5}$,
  our technique achieves an accuracy of $75.1%$ on CIFAR10, significantly higher than
  $68.1%$ achieved by the state of the art.'
