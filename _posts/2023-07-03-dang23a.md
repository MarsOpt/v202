title: Multiple Thinking Achieving Meta-Ability Decoupling for Object Navigation
openreview: OWROxDcS10
abstract: 'We propose a meta-ability decoupling (MAD) paradigm, which brings together
  various object navigation methods in an architecture system, allowing them to mutually
  enhance each other and evolve together. Based on the MAD paradigm, we design a multiple
  thinking (MT) model that leverages distinct thinking to abstract various meta-abilities.
  Our method decouples meta-abilities from three aspects: input, encoding, and reward
  while employing the multiple thinking collaboration (MTC) module to promote mutual
  cooperation between thinking. MAD introduces a novel qualitative and quantitative
  interpretability system for object navigation. Through extensive experiments on
  AI2-Thor and RoboTHOR, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
  (SOTA) methods on both typical and zero-shot object navigation tasks.'
