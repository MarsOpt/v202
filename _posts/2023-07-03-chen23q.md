title: 'Improved Analysis of Score-based Generative Modeling: User-Friendly Bounds
  under Minimal Smoothness Assumptions'
openreview: wi7T6VhNk2
abstract: 'We give an improved theoretical analysis of score-based generative modeling.
  Under a score estimate with small $L^2$ error (averaged across timesteps), we provide
  efficient convergence guarantees for any data distribution with second-order moment,
  by either employing early stopping or assuming smoothness condition on the score
  function of the data distribution. Our result does not rely on any log-concavity
  or functional inequality assumption and has a logarithmic dependence on the smoothness.
  In particular, we show that under only a finite second moment condition, approximating
  the following in reverse KL divergence in $\epsilon$-accuracy can be done in $\tilde
  O\left(\frac{d \log (1/\delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$ steps: 1) the variance-$\delta$
  Gaussian perturbation of any data distribution; 2) data distributions with $1/\delta$-smooth
  score functions. Our analysis also provides a quantitative comparison between different
  discrete approximations and may guide the choice of discretization points in practice.'
