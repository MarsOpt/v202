title: Polarity Is All You Need to Learn and Transfer Faster
openreview: tzxNDzYuMt
abstract: 'Natural intelligences (NIs) thrive in a dynamic world - they learn quickly,
  sometimes with only a few samples. In contrast, artificial intelligences (AIs) typically
  learn with a prohibitive number of training samples and computational power. What
  design principle difference between NI and AI could contribute to such a discrepancy?
  Here, we investigate the role of weight polarity: development processes initialize
  NIs with advantageous polarity configurations; as NIs grow and learn, synapse magnitudes
  update, yet polarities are largely kept unchanged. We demonstrate with simulation
  and image classification tasks that if weight polarities are <b>adequately</b> set
  <b><em>a priori</em></b>, then networks learn with less time and data. We also explicitly
  illustrate situations in which <em>a priori</em> setting the weight polarities is
  disadvantageous for networks. Our work illustrates the value of weight polarities
  from the perspective of statistical and computational efficiency during learning.'
