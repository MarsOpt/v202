title: Pre-computed memory or on-the-fly encoding? A hybrid approach to retrieval
  augmentation makes the most of your compute
openreview: nlUAvrMbUZ
abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models such as Fusion-in-Decoder are powerful,
  setting the state of the art on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks. However,
  they are also expensive, due to the need to encode a large number of retrieved passages.
  Some work avoids this cost by pre-encoding a text corpus into a memory and retrieving
  dense representations directly. However, pre-encoding memory incurs a severe quality
  penalty as the memory representations are not conditioned on the current input.
  We propose LUMEN, a hybrid between these two extremes, pre-computing the majority
  of the retrieval representation and completing the encoding on the fly using a live
  encoder that is conditioned on the question and fine-tuned for the task. We show
  that LUMEN significantly outperforms pure memory on multiple question-answering
  tasks while being much cheaper than FiD, and outperforms both for any given compute
  budget. Moreover, the advantage of LUMEN over FiD increases with model size.
