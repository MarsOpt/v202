title: Prototype-oriented unsupervised anomaly detection for multivariate time series
openreview: 3vO4lS6PuF
abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) of multivariate time series (MTS) aims
  to learn robust representations of normal multivariate temporal patterns. Existing
  UAD methods try to learn a fixed set of mappings for each MTS, entailing expensive
  computation and limited model adaptation. To address this pivotal issue, we propose
  a prototype-oriented UAD (PUAD) method under a probabilistic framework. Specifically,
  instead of learning the mappings for each MTS, the proposed PUAD views multiple
  MTSs as the distribution over a group of prototypes, which are extracted to represent
  a diverse set of normal patterns. To learn and regulate the prototypes, PUAD introduces
  a reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection approach, which incorporates
  a prototype-oriented optimal transport method into a Transformer-powered probabilistic
  dynamical generative framework. Leveraging meta-learned transferable prototypes,
  PUAD can achieve high model adaptation capacity for new MTSs. Experiments on five
  public MTS datasets all verify the effectiveness of the proposed UAD method.
