title: Robust Weak Supervision with Variational Auto-Encoders
openreview: YzXkFboejn
abstract: Recent advances in weak supervision (WS) techniques allow to mitigate the
  enormous cost and effort of human data annotation for supervised machine learning
  by automating it using simple rule-based labelling functions (LFs). However, LFs
  need to be carefully designed, often requiring expert domain knowledge and extensive
  validation for existing WS methods to be effective. To tackle this, we propose the
  Weak Supervision Variational Auto-Encoder (WS-VAE), a novel framework that combines
  unsupervised representation learning and weak labelling to reduce the dependence
  of WS on expert and manual engineering of LFs. Our technique learns from inputs
  and weak labels jointly to capture the input signals distribution with a latent
  space. The unsupervised representation component of the WS-VAE regularises the inference
  of weak labels, while a specifically designed decoder allows the model to learn
  the relevance of LFs for each input. These unique features lead to considerably
  improved robustness to the quality of LFs, compared to existing methods. An extensive
  empirical evaluation on a standard WS benchmark shows that our WS-VAE is competitive
  to state-of-the-art methods and substantially more robust to LF engineering.
