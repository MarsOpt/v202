title: 'DoMo-AC: Doubly Multi-step Off-policy Actor-Critic Algorithm'
openreview: PJ1NSXrzuI
abstract: Multi-step learning applies lookahead over multiple time steps and has proved
  valuable in policy evaluation settings. However, in the optimal control case, the
  impact of multi-step learning has been relatively limited despite a number of prior
  efforts. Fundamentally, this might be because multi-step policy improvements require
  operations that cannot be approximated by stochastic samples, hence hindering the
  widespread adoption of such methods in practice. To address such limitations, we
  introduce doubly multi-step off-policy VI (DoMo-VI), a novel oracle algorithm that
  combines multi-step policy improvements and policy evaluations. DoMo-VI enjoys guaranteed
  convergence speed-up to the optimal policy and is applicable in general off-policy
  learning settings. We then propose doubly multi-step off-policy actor-critic (DoMo-AC),
  a practical instantiation of the DoMo-VI algorithm. DoMo-AC introduces a bias-variance
  trade-off that ensures improved policy gradient estimates. When combined with the
  IMPALA architecture, DoMo-AC has showed improvements over the baseline algorithm
  on Atari-57 game benchmarks.
