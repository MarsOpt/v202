title: Enhancing Activity Prediction Models in Drug Discovery with the Ability to
  Understand Human Language
openreview: oeRMR0La70
abstract: Activity and property prediction models are the central workhorses in drug
  discovery and materials sciences, but currently, they have to be trained or fine-tuned
  for new tasks. Without training or fine-tuning, scientific language models could
  be used for such low-data tasks through their announced zero- and few-shot capabilities.
  However, their predictive quality at activity prediction is lacking. In this work,
  we envision a novel type of activity prediction model that is able to adapt to new
  prediction tasks at inference time, via understanding textual information describing
  the task. To this end, we propose a new architecture with separate modules for chemical
  and natural language inputs, and a contrastive pretraining objective on data from
  large biochemical databases. In extensive experiments, we show that our method CLAMP
  yields improved predictive performance on few-shot learning benchmarks and zero-shot
  problems in drug discovery. We attribute the advances of our method to the modularized
  architecture and to our pre-training objective.
