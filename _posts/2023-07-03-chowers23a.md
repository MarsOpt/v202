title: What do CNNs Learn in the First Layer and Why? A Linear Systems Perspective
openreview: RJGad2VFYk
abstract: It has previously been reported that the representation that is learned
  in the first layer of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is highly consistent
  across initializations and architectures. In this work, we quantify this consistency
  by considering the first layer as a filter bank and measuring its energy distribution.
  We find that the energy distribution is very different from that of the initial
  weights and is remarkably consistent across random initializations, datasets, architectures
  and even when the CNNs are trained with <em>random labels</em>. In order to explain
  this consistency, we derive an analytical formula for the energy profile of linear
  CNNs and show that this profile is mostly dictated by the second order statistics
  of image patches in the training set and it will approach a whitening transformation
  when the number of iterations goes to infinity. Finally, we show that this formula
  for linear CNNs also gives an excellent fit for the energy profiles learned by commonly
  used <em>nonlinear</em> CNNs such as ResNet and VGG, and that the first layer of
  these CNNs indeed performs approximate whitening of their inputs.
