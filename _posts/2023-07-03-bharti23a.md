title: Optimally-weighted Estimators of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy for Likelihood-Free
  Inference
openreview: s4dX9ymHrP
abstract: Likelihood-free inference methods typically make use of a distance between
  simulated and real data. A common example is the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD),
  which has previously been used for approximate Bayesian computation, minimum distance
  estimation, generalised Bayesian inference, and within the nonparametric learning
  framework. The MMD is commonly estimated at a root-$m$ rate, where $m$ is the number
  of simulated samples. This can lead to significant computational challenges since
  a large $m$ is required to obtain an accurate estimate, which is crucial for parameter
  estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for the MMD with significantly
  improved sample complexity. The estimator is particularly well suited for computationally
  expensive smooth simulators with low- to mid-dimensional inputs. This claim is supported
  through both theoretical results and an extensive simulation study on benchmark
  simulators.
