title: Text-To-4D Dynamic Scene Generation
openreview: YrXq8eG1EY
abstract: We present MAV3D (Make-A-Video3D), a method for generating three-dimensional
  dynamic scenes from text descriptions. Our approach uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance
  Field (NeRF), which is optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency
  by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The dynamic video output
  generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle,
  and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or
  4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using comprehensive quantitative
  and qualitative experiments and show an improvement over previously established
  internal baselines. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to generate
  3D dynamic scenes given a text description. Generated samples can be viewed at make-a-video3d.github.io
