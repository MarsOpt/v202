title: 'RankMe: Assessing the Downstream Performance of Pretrained Self-Supervised
  Representations by Their Rank'
openreview: neTWpgvVbo
abstract: 'Joint-Embedding Self Supervised Learning (JE-SSL) has seen a rapid development,
  with the emergence of many method variations but only few principled guidelines
  that would help practitioners to successfully deploy them. The main reason for that
  pitfall comes from JE-SSL’s core principle of not employing any input reconstruction
  therefore lacking visual cues of unsuccessful training. Adding non informative loss
  values to that, it becomes difficult to deploy SSL on a new dataset for which no
  labels can help to judge the quality of the learned representation. In this study,
  we develop a simple unsupervised criterion that is indicative of the quality of
  the learned JE-SSL representations: their effective rank. Albeit simple and computationally
  friendly, this method —coined RankMe— allows one to assess the performance of JE-SSL
  representations, even on different downstream datasets, without requiring any labels.
  A further benefit of RankMe is that it does not have any training or hyper-parameters
  to tune. Through thorough empirical experiments involving hundreds of training episodes,
  we demonstrate how RankMe can be used for hyperparameter selection with nearly no
  reduction in final performance compared to the current selection method that involve
  a dataset’s labels. We hope that RankMe will facilitate the deployment of JE-SSL
  towards domains that do not have the opportunity to rely on labels for representations’
  quality assessment.'
