title: Complementary Attention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
openreview: qEcJpq2Kjr
abstract: In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, centralized training
  with decentralized execution (CTDE) shows great promise for a trade-off between
  independent Q-learning and joint action learning. However, vanilla CTDE methods
  assumed a fixed number of agents could hardly adapt to real-world scenarios where
  dynamic team compositions typically suffer from dramatically variant partial observability.
  Specifically, agents with extensive sight ranges are prone to be affected by trivial
  environmental substrates, dubbed the "distracted attention" issue; ones with limited
  observation can hardly sense their teammates, degrading the cooperation quality.
  In this paper, we propose Complementary Attention for Multi-Agent reinforcement
  learning (CAMA), which applies a divide-and-conquer strategy on input entities accompanied
  with the complementary attention of enhancement and replenishment. Concretely, to
  tackle the distracted attention issue, highly contributed entitiesâ€™ attention is
  enhanced by the execution-related representation extracted via action prediction
  with an inverse model. For better out-of-sight-range cooperation, the lowly contributed
  ones are compressed to brief messages with a conditional mutual information estimator.
  Our CAMA facilitates stable and sustainable teamwork, which is justified by the
  impressive results reported on the challenging StarCraftII, MPE, and Traffic Junction
  benchmarks.
