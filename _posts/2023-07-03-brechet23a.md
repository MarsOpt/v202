title: Critical Points and Convergence Analysis of Generative Deep Linear Networks
  Trained with Bures-Wasserstein Loss
openreview: S9kFcPHqHP
abstract: We consider a deep matrix factorization model of covariance matrices trained
  with the Bures-Wasserstein distance. While recent works have made advances in the
  study of the optimization problem for overparametrized low-rank matrix approximation,
  much emphasis has been placed on discriminative settings and the square loss. In
  contrast, our model considers another type of loss and connects with the generative
  setting. We characterize the critical points and minimizers of the Bures-Wasserstein
  distance over the space of rank-bounded matrices. The Hessian of this loss at low-rank
  matrices can theoretically blow up, which creates challenges to analyze convergence
  of gradient optimization methods. We establish convergence results for gradient
  flow using a smooth perturbative version of the loss as well as convergence results
  for finite step size gradient descent under certain assumptions on the initial weights.
