title: 'Curiosity in Hindsight: Intrinsic Exploration in Stochastic Environments'
openreview: fIH2G4fnSy
abstract: 'Consider the problem of exploration in sparse-reward or reward-free environments,
  such as in Montezuma’s Revenge. In the <em>curiosity-driven</em> paradigm, the agent
  is rewarded for how much each realized outcome differs from their predicted outcome.
  But using predictive error as intrinsic motivation is fragile in <em>stochastic
  environments</em>, as the agent may become trapped by high-entropy areas of the
  state-action space, such as a "noisy TV". In this work, we study a natural solution
  derived from structural causal models of the world: Our key idea is to learn representations
  of the future that capture precisely the <em>unpredictable</em> aspects of each
  outcome—which we use as additional input for predictions, such that intrinsic rewards
  only reflect the <em>predictable</em> aspects of world dynamics. First, we propose
  incorporating such hindsight representations into models to disentangle "noise"
  from "novelty", yielding <em>Curiosity in Hindsight</em>: a simple and scalable
  generalization of curiosity that is robust to stochasticity. Second, we instantiate
  this framework for the recently introduced BYOL-Explore algorithm as our prime example,
  resulting in the noise-robust BYOL-Hindsight. Third, we illustrate its behavior
  under a variety of different stochasticities in a grid world, and find improvements
  over BYOL-Explore in hard-exploration Atari games with sticky actions. Notably,
  we show state-of-the-art results in exploring Montezuma’s Revenge with sticky actions,
  while preserving performance in the non-sticky setting.'
