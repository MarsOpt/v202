title: The Value of Out-of-Distribution Data
openreview: 8D3SsQlRbY
abstract: 'Generalization error always improves with more in-distribution data. However,
  it is an open question what happens as we add out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Intuitively,
  if the OOD data is quite different, it seems more data would harm generalization
  error, though if the OOD data are sufficiently similar, much empirical evidence
  suggests that OOD data can actually improve generalization error. We show a counter-intuitive
  phenomenon: the generalization error of a task can be a non-monotonic function of
  the amount of OOD data. Specifically, we prove that generalization error can improve
  with small amounts of OOD data, and then get worse than no OOD data with larger
  amounts. In other words, there is value in training on small amounts of OOD data.
  We analytically demonstrate these results via Fisherâ€™s Linear Discriminant on synthetic
  datasets, and empirically demonstrate them via deep networks on computer vision
  benchmarks such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CINIC-10, PACS and DomainNet. In the idealistic
  setting where we know which samples are OOD, we show that these non-monotonic trends
  can be exploited using an appropriately weighted objective of the target and OOD
  empirical risk. While its practical utility is limited, this does suggest that if
  we can detect OOD samples, then there may be ways to benefit from them. When we
  do not know which samples are OOD, we show how a number of go-to strategies such
  as data-augmentation, hyper-parameter optimization and pre-training are not enough
  to ensure that the target generalization error does not deteriorate with the number
  of OOD samples in the dataset.'
