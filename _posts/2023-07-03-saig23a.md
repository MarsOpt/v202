title: 'Learning to Suggest Breaks: Sustainable Optimization of Long-Term User Engagement'
openreview: dopVDyZSEW
abstract: Optimizing user engagement is a key goal for modern recommendation systems,
  but blindly pushing users towards increased consumption risks burn-out, churn, or
  even addictive habits. To promote digital well-being, most platforms now offer a
  service that periodically prompts users to take breaks. These, however, must be
  set up manually, and so may be suboptimal for both users and the system. In this
  paper, we study the role of breaks in recommendation, and propose a framework for
  learning optimal breaking policies that promote and sustain long-term engagement.
  Based on the notion that recommendation dynamics are susceptible to both positive
  and negative feedback, we cast recommendation as a Lotka-Volterra dynamical system,
  where breaking reduces to a problem of optimal control. We then give an efficient
  learning algorithm, provide theoretical guarantees, and empirically demonstrate
  the utility of our approach on semi-synthetic data.
