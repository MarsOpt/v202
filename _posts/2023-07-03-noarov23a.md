title: The Statistical Scope of Multicalibration
openreview: tyqL1bPl0L
abstract: We make a connection between multicalibration and property elicitation and
  show that (under mild technical conditions) it is possible to produce a multicalibrated
  predictor for a continuous scalar property $\Gamma$ if and only if $\Gamma$ is <em>elicitable</em>.
  On the negative side, we show that for non-elicitable continuous properties there
  exist simple data distributions on which even the true distributional predictor
  is not calibrated. On the positive side, for elicitable $\Gamma$, we give simple
  canonical algorithms for the batch and the online adversarial setting, that learn
  a $\Gamma$-multicalibrated predictor. This generalizes past work on multicalibrated
  means and quantiles, and in fact strengthens existing online quantile multicalibration
  results. To further counter-weigh our negative result, we show that if a property
  $\Gamma^1$ is not elicitable by itself, but <em>is</em> elicitable <em>conditionally</em>
  on another elicitable property $\Gamma^0$, then there is a canonical algorithm that
  <em>jointly</em> multicalibrates $\Gamma^1$ and $\Gamma^0$; this generalizes past
  work on mean-moment multicalibration. Finally, as applications of our theory, we
  provide novel algorithmic and impossibility results for fair (multicalibrated) risk
  assessment.
