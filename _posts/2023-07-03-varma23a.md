title: Conditional Tree Matching for Inference-Time Adaptation of Tree Prediction
  Models
openreview: R7X1sTaM6J
abstract: We present CTreeOT, a convergent, differentiable algorithm for matching
  two trees when each tree is conditioned on some input. Such conditional tree matching
  is useful for light-weight, few-shot adaptation of tree prediction models without
  parameter fine-tuning. CTreeOT includes an alignment algorithm that extends the
  popular Sinkhorn algorithm for matching tree nodes while supporting constraints
  on tree edges. The algorithm involves alternating between matrix rescaling and message
  passing updates, and can be efficiently expressed as GPU tensor operations. The
  second part of CTreeOT is fine-grained relevance-based reweighting of nodes that
  makes the match scores useful for prediction tasks. We demonstrate the usefulness
  of CTreeOT for cross-schema adaptation of Text-to-SQL, a popular semantic parsing
  task. We show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, we achieve significant
  increase in adaptation accuracy.
