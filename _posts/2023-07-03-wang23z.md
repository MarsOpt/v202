title: Curriculum Co-disentangled Representation Learning across Multiple Environments
  for Social Recommendation
openreview: kMnEaXGuZr
abstract: There exist complex patterns behind the decision-making processes of different
  individuals across different environments. For instance, in a social recommender
  system, various user behaviors are driven by highly entangled latent factors from
  two environments, i.e., consuming environment where users consume items and social
  environment where users connect with each other. Uncovering the disentanglement
  of these latent factors for users can benefit in enhanced explainability and controllability
  for recommendation. However, in literature there has been no work on social recommendation
  capable of disentangling user representations across consuming and social environments.
  To solve this problem, we study co-disentangled representation learning across different
  environments via proposing the curriculum co-disentangled representation learning
  (CurCoDis) model to disentangle the hidden factors for users across both consuming
  and social environments. To co-disentangle joint representations for user-item consumption
  and user-user social graph simultaneously, we partition the social graph into equal-size
  sub-graphs with minimum number of edges being cut, and design a curriculum weighing
  strategy for subgraph training through measuring the complexity of subgraphs via
  Descartesâ€™ rule of signs. We further develop the prototype-routing optimization
  mechanism, which achieves co-disentanglement of user representations across consuming
  and social environments. Extensive experiments for social recommendation demonstrate
  that our proposed CurCoDis model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods
  on several real-world datasets.
