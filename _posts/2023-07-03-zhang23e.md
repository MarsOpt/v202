title: Graph Contrastive Backdoor Attacks
openreview: BfVkbfJGW4
abstract: 'Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable interest due
  to its impressive node representation learning capability. Despite the wide application
  of GCL techniques, little attention has been paid to the security of GCL. In this
  paper, we systematically study the vulnerability of GCL in the presence of malicious
  backdoor adversaries. In particular, we propose <em>GCBA</em>, the first backdoor
  attack for graph contrastive learning. GCBA incorporates three attacks: poisoning,
  crafting, and natural backdoor, each targeting one stage of the GCL pipeline. We
  formulate our attacks as optimization problems and solve them with a novel discrete
  optimization technique to overcome the discrete nature of graph-structured data.
  By extensively evaluating GCBA on multiple datasets and GCL methods, we show that
  our attack can achieve high attack success rates while preserving stealthiness.
  We further consider potential countermeasures to our attack and conclude that existing
  defenses are insufficient to mitigate GCBA. We show that as a complex paradigm involving
  data and model republishing, GCL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, and specifically
  designed defenses are needed to mitigate the backdoor attacks on GCL.'
