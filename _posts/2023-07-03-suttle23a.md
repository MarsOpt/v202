title: Beyond Exponentially Fast Mixing in Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning via
  Multi-Level Monte Carlo Actor-Critic
openreview: DVinvfAvIB
abstract: Many existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods employ stochastic gradient
  iteration on the back end, whose stability hinges upon a hypothesis that the data-generating
  process mixes exponentially fast with a rate parameter that appears in the step-size
  selection. Unfortunately, this assumption is violated for large state spaces or
  settings with sparse rewards, and the mixing time is unknown, making the step size
  inoperable. In this work, we propose an RL methodology attuned to the mixing time
  by employing a multi-level Monte Carlo estimator for the critic, the actor, and
  the average reward embedded within an actor-critic (AC) algorithm. This method,
  which we call <b>M</b>ulti-level <b>A</b>ctor-<b>C</b>ritic (MAC), is developed
  specifically for infinite-horizon average-reward settings and neither relies on
  oracle knowledge of the mixing time in its parameter selection nor assumes its exponential
  decay; it is therefore readily applicable to applications with slower mixing times.
  Nonetheless, it achieves a convergence rate comparable to SOTA actor-critic algorithms.
  We experimentally show that these alleviated restrictions on the technical conditions
  required for stability translate to superior performance in practice for RL problems
  with sparse rewards.
