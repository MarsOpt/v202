title: 'Escaping saddle points in zeroth-order optimization: the power of two-point
  estimators'
openreview: qZ1reqm5BM
abstract: Two-point zeroth order methods are important in many applications of zeroth-order
  optimization arising in robotics, wind farms, power systems, online optimization,
  and adversarial robustness to black-box attacks in deep neural networks, where the
  problem can be high-dimensional and/or time-varying. Furthermore, such problems
  may be nonconvex and contain saddle points. While existing works have shown that
  zeroth-order methods utilizing $\Omega(d)$ function valuations per iteration (with
  $d$ denoting the problem dimension) can escape saddle points efficiently, it remains
  an open question if zeroth-order methods based on two-point estimators can escape
  saddle points. In this paper, we show that by adding an appropriate isotropic perturbation
  at each iteration, a zeroth-order algorithm based on $2m$ (for any $1 \leq m \leq
  d$) function evaluations per iteration can not only find $\epsilon$-second order
  stationary points polynomially fast, but do so using only $\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{m\epsilon^{2}\bar{\psi}})$
  function evaluations, where $\bar{\psi} \geq \tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ is
  a parameter capturing the extent to which the function of interest exhibits the
  strict saddle property.
