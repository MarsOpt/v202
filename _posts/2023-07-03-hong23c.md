title: Revisiting Data-Free Knowledge Distillation with Poisoned Teachers
openreview: YhRsYVwTHv
abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (KD) helps transfer knowledge from a pre-trained
  model (known as the teacher model) to a smaller model (known as the student model)
  without access to the original training data used for training the teacher model.
  However, the security of the synthetic or out-of-distribution (OOD) data required
  in data-free KD is largely unknown and under-explored. In this work, we make the
  first effort to uncover the security risk of data-free KD w.r.t. untrusted pre-trained
  models. We then propose Anti-Backdoor Data-Free KD (ABD), the first plug-in defensive
  method for data-free KD methods to mitigate the chance of potential backdoors being
  transferred. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed ABD in diminishing
  transferred backdoor knowledge while maintaining compatible downstream performances
  as the vanilla KD. We envision this work as a milestone for alarming and mitigating
  the potential backdoors in data-free KD. Codes are released at https://github.com/illidanlab/ABD
