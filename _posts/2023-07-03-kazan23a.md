title: 'The Test of Tests: A Framework for Differentially Private Hypothesis Testing'
openreview: 276wXXz5Ze
abstract: We present a generic framework for creating differentially private versions
  of any hypothesis test in a black-box way. We analyze the resulting tests analytically
  and experimentally. Most crucially, we show good practical performance for small
  data sets, showing that at Îµ = 1 we only need 5-6 times as much data as in the fully
  public setting. We compare our work to the one existing framework of this type,
  as well as to several individually-designed private hypothesis tests. Our framework
  is higher power than other generic solutions and at least competitive with (and
  often better than) individually-designed tests.
