title: Fair and Accurate Decision Making through Group-Aware Learning
openreview: p2gZYLZVEb
abstract: 'The integration of machine learning models in various real-world applications
  is becoming more prevalent to assist humans in their daily decision-making tasks
  as a result of recent advancements in this field. However, it has been discovered
  that there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and fairness of these decision-making
  tasks. In some cases, these AI systems can be unfair by exhibiting bias or discrimination
  against certain social groups, which can have severe consequences in real life.
  Inspired by one of the most well-known human learning skills called grouping, we
  address this issue by proposing a novel machine learning (ML) framework where the
  ML model learns to group a diverse set of problems into distinct subgroups to solve
  each subgroup using its specific sub-model. Our proposed framework involves three
  stages of learning, which are formulated as a three-level optimization problem:
  1) grouping problems into subgroups, 2) learning group-specific sub-models for problem-solving,
  and 3) updating group assignments of training examples by minimizing validation
  loss. These three learning stages are performed end-to-end in a joint manner using
  gradient descent. To improve fairness and accuracy, we develop an efficient optimization
  algorithm to solve this three-level optimization problem. To further decrease the
  risk of overfitting in small datasets using our LBG method, we incorporate domain
  adaptation techniques in the second stage of training. We further apply our method
  to differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) methods.'
