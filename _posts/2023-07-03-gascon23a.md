title: Federated Heavy Hitter Recovery under Linear Sketching
openreview: zN4oRCrlnM
abstract: Motivated by real-life deployments of multi-round federated analytics with
  secure aggregation, we investigate the fundamental communication-accuracy tradeoffs
  of the heavy hitter discovery and approximate (open-domain) histogram problems under
  a linear sketching constraint. We propose efficient algorithms based on local subsampling
  and invertible bloom look-up tables (IBLTs). We also show that our algorithms are
  information-theoretically optimal for a broad class of interactive schemes. The
  results show that the linear sketching constraint does increase the communication
  cost for both tasks by introducing an extra linear dependence on the number of users
  in a round. Moreover, our results also establish a separation between the communication
  cost for heavy hitter discovery and approximate histogram in the multi-round setting.
  The dependence on the number of rounds $R$ is at most logarithmic for heavy hitter
  discovery whereas that of approximate histogram is $\Theta(\sqrt{R})$. We also empirically
  demonstrate our findings.
