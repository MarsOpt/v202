title: Quantum Policy Gradient Algorithm with Optimized Action Decoding
openreview: 2L435rBxrF
abstract: Quantum machine learning implemented by variational quantum circuits (VQCs)
  is considered a promising concept for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing
  era. Focusing on applications in quantum reinforcement learning, we propose an action
  decoding procedure for a quantum policy gradient approach. We introduce a quality
  measure that enables us to optimize the classical post-processing required for action
  selection, inspired by local and global quantum measurements. The resulting algorithm
  demonstrates a significant performance improvement in several benchmark environments.
  With this technique, we successfully execute a full training routine on a 5-qubit
  hardware device. Our method introduces only negligible classical overhead and has
  the potential to improve VQC-based algorithms beyond the field of quantum reinforcement
  learning.
