title: 'Fourmer: An Efficient Global Modeling Paradigm for Image Restoration'
openreview: XMer44w2u9
abstract: 'Global modeling-based image restoration frameworks have become popular.
  However, they often require a high memory footprint and do not consider task-specific
  degradation. Our work presents an alternative approach to global modeling that is
  more efficient for image restoration. The key insights which motivate our study
  are two-fold: 1) Fourier transform is capable of disentangling image degradation
  and content component to a certain extent, serving as the image degradation prior,
  and 2) Fourier domain innately embraces global properties, where each pixel in the
  Fourier space is involved with all spatial pixels. While adhering to the “spatial
  interaction + channel evolution” rule of previous studies, we customize the core
  designs with Fourier spatial interaction modeling and Fourier channel evolution.
  Our paradigm, Fourmer, achieves competitive performance on common image restoration
  tasks such as image de-raining, image enhancement, image dehazing, and guided image
  super-resolution, while requiring fewer computational resources. The code for Fourmer
  will be made publicly available.'
