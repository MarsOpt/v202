title: Enabling First-Order Gradient-Based Learning for Equilibrium Computation in
  Markets
openreview: eZNZbI5JuH
abstract: Understanding and analyzing markets is crucial, yet analytical equilibrium
  solutions remain largely infeasible. Recent breakthroughs in equilibrium computation
  rely on zeroth-order policy gradient estimation. These approaches commonly suffer
  from high variance and are computationally expensive. The use of fully differentiable
  simulators would enable more efficient gradient estimation. However, the discrete
  allocation of goods in economic simulations is a non-differentiable operation. This
  renders the first-order Monte Carlo gradient estimator inapplicable and the learning
  feedback systematically misleading. We propose a novel smoothing technique that
  creates a surrogate market game, in which first-order methods can be applied. We
  provide theoretical bounds on the resulting bias which justifies solving the smoothed
  game instead. These bounds also allow choosing the smoothing strength a priori such
  that the resulting estimate has low variance. Furthermore, we validate our approach
  via numerous empirical experiments. Our method theoretically and empirically outperforms
  zeroth-order methods in approximation quality and computational efficiency.
