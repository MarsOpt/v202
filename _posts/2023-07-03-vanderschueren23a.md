title: Accounting For Informative Sampling When Learning to Forecast Treatment Outcomes
  Over Time
openreview: qaPmiAGZcV
abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential for accurately forecasting treatment
  outcomes over time, which could ultimately enable the adoption of more individualized
  treatment strategies in many practical applications. However, a significant challenge
  that has been largely overlooked by the ML literature on this topic is the presence
  of informative sampling in observational data. When instances are observed irregularly
  over time, sampling times are typically not random, but rather informative–depending
  on the instance’s characteristics, past outcomes, and administered treatments. In
  this work, we formalize informative sampling as a covariate shift problem and show
  that it can prohibit accurate estimation of treatment outcomes if not properly accounted
  for. To overcome this challenge, we present a general framework for learning treatment
  outcomes in the presence of informative sampling using inverse intensity-weighting,
  and propose a novel method, TESAR-CDE, that instantiates this framework using Neural
  CDEs. Using a simulation environment based on a clinical use case, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach in learning under informative sampling.
