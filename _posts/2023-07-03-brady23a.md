title: Provably Learning Object-Centric Representations
openreview: mGUJMqjDwE
abstract: Learning structured representations of the visual world in terms of objects
  promises to significantly improve the generalization abilities of current machine
  learning models. While recent efforts to this end have shown promising empirical
  progress, a theoretical account of when unsupervised object-centric representation
  learning is possible is still lacking. Consequently, understanding the reasons for
  the success of existing object-centric methods as well as designing new theoretically
  grounded methods remains challenging. In the present work, we analyze when object-centric
  representations can provably be learned without supervision. To this end, we first
  introduce two assumptions on the generative process for scenes comprised of several
  objects, which we call compositionality and irreducibility. Under this generative
  process, we prove that the ground-truth object representations can be identified
  by an invertible and compositional inference model, even in the presence of dependencies
  between objects. We empirically validate our results through experiments on synthetic
  data. Finally, we provide evidence that our theory holds predictive power for existing
  object-centric models by showing a close correspondence between models’ compositionality
  and invertibility and their empirical identifiability.
