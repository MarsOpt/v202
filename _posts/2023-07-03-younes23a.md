title: Entropy-driven Unsupervised Keypoint Representation Learning in Videos
openreview: 9mGbxC4QiI
abstract: Extracting informative representations from videos is fundamental for effectively
  learning various downstream tasks. We present a novel approach for unsupervised
  learning of meaningful representations from videos, leveraging the concept of image
  spatial entropy (ISE) that quantifies the per-pixel information in an image. We
  argue that local entropy of pixel neighborhoods and their temporal evolution create
  valuable intrinsic supervisory signals for learning prominent features. Building
  on this idea, we abstract visual features into a concise representation of keypoints
  that act as dynamic information transmitters, and design a deep learning model that
  learns, purely unsupervised, spatially and temporally consistent representations
  directly from video frames. Two original information-theoretic losses, computed
  from local entropy, guide our model to discover consistent keypoint representations;
  a loss that maximizes the spatial information covered by the keypoints and a loss
  that optimizes the keypointsâ€™ information transportation over time. We compare our
  keypoint representation to strong baselines for various downstream tasks, e.g.,
  learning object dynamics. Our empirical results show superior performance for our
  information-driven keypoints that resolve challenges like attendance to static and
  dynamic objects or objects abruptly entering and leaving the scene.
