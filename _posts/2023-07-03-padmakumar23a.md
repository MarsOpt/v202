title: Extrapolative Controlled Sequence Generation via Iterative Refinement
openreview: EuUeVUS6UV
abstract: We study the problem of extrapolative controlled generation, i.e., generating
  sequences with attribute values beyond the range seen in training. This task is
  of significant importance in automated design, especially drug discovery, where
  the goal is to design novel proteins that are better (e.g., more stable) than existing
  sequences. Thus, by definition the target sequences and their attribute values are
  out of the training distribution, posing challenges to existing methods that aim
  to directly generate the target sequence. Instead, in this work, we propose Iterative
  Controlled Extrapolation (ICE) which iteratively makes local edits to a sequence
  to enable extrapolation. We train the model on synthetically generated sequence
  pairs that demonstrate small improvement in the attribute value. Results on one
  natural language task (sentiment analysis) and two protein engineering tasks (ACE2
  stability and AAV fitness) show that ICE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
  despite its simplicity.
