title: Flexible Phase Dynamics for Bio-Plausible Contrastive Learning
openreview: 7BxPT6X3sj
abstract: Many learning algorithms used as normative models in neuroscience or as
  candidate approaches for learning on neuromorphic chips learn by contrasting one
  set of network states with another. These Contrastive Learning (CL) algorithms are
  traditionally implemented with rigid, temporally non-local, and periodic learning
  dynamics, that could limit the range of physical systems capable of harnessing CL.
  In this study, we build on recent work exploring how CL might be implemented by
  biological or neurmorphic systems and show that this form of learning can be made
  temporally local, and can still function even if many of the dynamical requirements
  of standard training procedures are relaxed. Thanks to a set of general theorems
  corroborated by numerical experiments across several CL models, our results provide
  theoretical foundations for the study and development of CL methods for biological
  and neuromorphic neural networks.
