title: Efficient and Degree-Guided Graph Generation via Discrete Diffusion Modeling
openreview: vn9O1N5ZOw
abstract: 'Diffusion-based generative graph models have been proven effective in generating
  high-quality small graphs. However, they need to be more scalable for generating
  large graphs containing thousands of nodes desiring graph statistics. In this work,
  we propose EDGE, a new diffusion-based generative graph model that addresses generative
  tasks with large graphs. To improve computation efficiency, we encourage graph sparsity
  by using a discrete diffusion process that randomly removes edges at each time step
  and finally obtains an empty graph. EDGE only focuses on a portion of nodes in the
  graph at each denoising step. It makes much fewer edge predictions than previous
  diffusion-based models. Moreover, EDGE admits explicitly modeling the node degrees
  of the graphs, further improving the model performance. The empirical study shows
  that EDGE is much more efficient than competing methods and can generate large graphs
  with thousands of nodes. It also outperforms baseline models in generation quality:
  graphs generated by our approach have more similar graph statistics to those of
  the training graphs.'
