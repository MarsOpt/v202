title: Streaming Active Learning with Deep Neural Networks
openreview: ZDcKFyL1F9
abstract: Active learning is perhaps most naturally posed as an online learning problem.
  However, prior active learning approaches with deep neural networks assume offline
  access to the entire dataset ahead of time. This paper proposes VeSSAL, a new algorithm
  for batch active learning with deep neural networks in streaming settings, which
  samples groups of points to query for labels at the moment they are encountered.
  Our approach trades off between uncertainty and diversity of queried samples to
  match a desired query rate without requiring any hand-tuned hyperparameters. Altogether,
  we expand the applicability of deep neural networks to realistic active learning
  scenarios, such as applications relevant to HCI and large, fractured datasets.
