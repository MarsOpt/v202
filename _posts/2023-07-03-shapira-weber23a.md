title: Regularization-free Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets
openreview: 7IbLWa0anE
abstract: In time-series analysis, nonlinear temporal misalignment is a major problem
  that forestalls even simple averaging. An effective learning-based solution for
  this problem is the Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Net (DTAN), that, by relying
  on a diffeomorphic temporal transformer net and the amortization of the joint-alignment
  task, eliminates drawbacks of traditional alignment methods. Unfortunately, existing
  DTAN formulations crucially depend on a regularization term whose optimal hyperparameters
  are dataset-specific and usually searched via a large number of experiments. Here
  we propose a regularization-free DTAN that obviates the need to perform such an
  expensive, and often impractical, search. Concretely, we propose a new well-behaved
  loss that we call the Inverse Consistency Averaging Error (ICAE), as well as a related
  new triplet loss. Extensive experiments on 128 UCR datasets show that the proposed
  method outperforms contemporary methods despite not using a regularization. Moreover,
  ICAE also gives rise to the first DTAN that supports variable-length signals. Our
  code is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/RF-DTAN.
