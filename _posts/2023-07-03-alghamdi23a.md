title: The Saddle-Point Method in Differential Privacy
openreview: IK7UWsjhUp
abstract: We characterize the differential privacy guarantees of privacy mechanisms
  in the large-composition regime, i.e., when a privacy mechanism is sequentially
  applied a large number of times to sensitive data. Via exponentially tilting the
  privacy loss random variable, we derive a new formula for the privacy curve expressing
  it as a contour integral over an integration path that runs parallel to the imaginary
  axis with a free real-axis intercept. Then, using the method of steepest descent
  from mathematical physics, we demonstrate that the choice of saddle-point as the
  real-axis intercept yields closed-form accurate approximations of the desired contour
  integral. This procedure—dubbed the saddle-point accountant (SPA)—yields a constant-time
  accurate approximation of the privacy curve. Theoretically, our results can be viewed
  as a refinement of both Gaussian Differential Privacy and the moments accountant
  method found in Rényi Differential Privacy. In practice, we demonstrate through
  numerical experiments that the SPA provides a precise approximation of privacy guarantees
  competitive with purely numerical-based methods (such as FFT-based accountants),
  while enjoying closed-form mathematical expressions.
