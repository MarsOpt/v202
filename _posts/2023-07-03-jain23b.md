title: The Price of Differential Privacy under Continual Observation
openreview: yPUc796tVF
abstract: We study the accuracy of differentially private mechanisms in the continual
  release model. A continual release mechanism receives a sensitive dataset as a stream
  of $T$ inputs and produces, after receiving each input, an output that is accurate
  for all the inputs received so far. We provide the first strong lower bounds on
  the error of continual release mechanisms. In particular, for two fundamental problems
  that are closely related to empirical risk minimization and widely studied and used
  in the standard (batch) model, we prove that the worst case error of every continual
  release algorithm is $\tilde \Omega(T^{1/3})$ times larger than that of the best
  batch algorithm. Previous work shows only a $\Omega(\log T)$ gap between the worst
  case error achievable in these two models. We also formulate a model that allows
  for adaptively selected inputs, thus capturing dependencies that arise in many applications
  of continual release. Even though, in general, both privacy and accuracy are harder
  to attain in this model, we show that our lower bounds are matched by the error
  of simple algorithms that work even for adaptively selected inputs.
