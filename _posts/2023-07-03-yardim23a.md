title: Policy Mirror Ascent for Efficient and Independent Learning in Mean Field Games
openreview: AwxfYvdPZV
abstract: Mean-field games have been used as a theoretical tool to obtain an approximate
  Nash equilibrium for symmetric and anonymous $N$-player games. However, limiting
  applicability, existing theoretical results assume variations of a “population generative
  model”, which allows arbitrary modifications of the population distribution by the
  learning algorithm. Moreover, learning algorithms typically work on abstract simulators
  with population instead of the $N$-player game. Instead, we show that $N$ agents
  running policy mirror ascent converge to the Nash equilibrium of the regularized
  game within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples from a single sample
  trajectory without a population generative model, up to a standard $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$
  error due to the mean field. Taking a divergent approach from the literature, instead
  of working with the best-response map we first show that a policy mirror ascent
  map can be used to construct a contractive operator having the Nash equilibrium
  as its fixed point. We analyze single-path TD learning for $N$-agent games, proving
  sample complexity guarantees by only using a sample path from the $N$-agent simulator
  without a population generative model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology
  allows for independent learning by $N$ agents with finite sample guarantees.
