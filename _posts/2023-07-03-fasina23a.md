title: Neural FIM for learning Fisher information metrics from point cloud data
openreview: SarkXIzrXh
abstract: Although data diffusion embeddings are ubiquitous in unsupervised learning
  and have proven to be a viable technique for uncovering the underlying intrinsic
  geometry of data, diffusion embeddings are inherently limited due to their discrete
  nature. To this end, we propose neural FIM, a method for computing the Fisher information
  metric (FIM) from point cloud data - allowing for a continuous manifold model for
  the data. Neural FIM creates an extensible metric space from discrete point cloud
  data such that information from the metric can inform us of manifold characteristics
  such as volume and geodesics. We demonstrate Neural FIMâ€™s utility in selecting parameters
  for the PHATE visualization method as well as its ability to obtain information
  pertaining to local volume illuminating branching points and cluster centers embeddings
  of a toy dataset and two single-cell datasets of IPSC reprogramming and PBMCs (immune
  cells).
