title: Nearly Optimal Competitive Ratio for Online Allocation Problems with Two-sided
  Resource Constraints and Finite Requests
openreview: pWVeL1NuK7
abstract: In this paper, we investigate the online allocation problem of maximizing
  the overall revenue subject to both lower and upper bound constraints. Compared
  to the extensively studied online problems with only resource upper bounds, the
  two-sided constraints affect the prospects of resource consumption more severely.
  As a result, only limited violations of constraints or pessimistic competitive bounds
  could be guaranteed. To tackle the challenge, we define a measure of feasibility
  $\xi^*$ to evaluate the hardness of this problem, and estimate this measurement
  by an optimization routine with theoretical guarantees. We propose an online algorithm
  adopting a constructive framework, where we initialize a threshold price vector
  using the estimation, then dynamically update the price vector and use it for decision-making
  at each step. It can be shown that the proposed algorithm is $\big(1-O(\frac{\varepsilon}{\xi^*-\varepsilon})\big)$
  or $\big(1-O(\frac{\varepsilon}{\xi^*-\sqrt{\varepsilon}})\big)$ competitive with
  high probability for $\xi^*$ known or unknown respectively. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first result establishing a nearly optimal competitive algorithm for
  solving two-sided constrained online allocation problems with a high probability
  of feasibility.
