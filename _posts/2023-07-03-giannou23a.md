title: Looped Transformers as Programmable Computers
openreview: fiHVIUkulb
abstract: We present a framework for using transformer networks as universal computers
  by programming them with specific weights and placing them in a loop. Our input
  sequence acts as a punchcard, consisting of instructions and memory for data read/writes.
  We demonstrate that a constant number of encoder layers can emulate basic computing
  blocks, including lexicographic operations, non-linear functions, function calls,
  program counters, and conditional branches. Using this framework, we emulate a computer
  using a simple instruction-set architecture, which allows us to map iterative algorithms
  to programs that can be executed by a constant depth looped transformer network.
  We show how a single frozen transformer, instructed by its input, can emulate a
  basic calculator, a basic linear algebra library, and even a full backpropagation,
  in-context learning algorithm. Our findings reveal the potential of transformer
  networks as programmable compute units and offer insight into the mechanics of attention.
