title: Gibbsian Polar Slice Sampling
openreview: K2RnHMiUrW
abstract: Polar slice sampling (Roberts & Rosenthal, 2002) is a Markov chain approach
  for approximate sampling of distributions that is difficult, if not impossible,
  to implement efficiently, but behaves provably well with respect to the dimension.
  By updating the directional and radial components of chain iterates separately,
  we obtain a family of samplers that mimic polar slice sampling, and yet can be implemented
  efficiently. Numerical experiments in a variety of settings indicate that our proposed
  algorithm outperforms the two most closely related approaches, elliptical slice
  sampling (Murray et al., 2010) and hit-and-run uniform slice sampling (MacKay, 2003).
  We prove the well-definedness and convergence of our methods under suitable assumptions
  on the target distribution.
