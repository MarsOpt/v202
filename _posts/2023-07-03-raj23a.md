title: Algorithmic Stability of Heavy-Tailed SGD with General Loss Functions
openreview: 9ZNtKRQUGR
abstract: Heavy-tail phenomena in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been reported
  in several empirical studies. Experimental evidence in previous works suggests a
  strong interplay between the heaviness of the tails and generalization behavior
  of SGD. To address this empirical phenomena theoretically, several works have made
  strong topological and statistical assumptions to link the generalization error
  to heavy tails. Very recently, new generalization bounds have been proven, indicating
  a non-monotonic relationship between the generalization error and heavy tails, which
  is more pertinent to the reported empirical observations. While these bounds do
  not require additional topological assumptions given that SGD can be modeled using
  a heavy-tailed stochastic differential equation (SDE), they can only apply to simple
  quadratic problems. In this paper, we build on this line of research and develop
  generalization bounds for a more general class of objective functions, which includes
  non-convex functions as well. Our approach is based on developing Wasserstein stability
  bounds for heavy-tailed SDEs and their discretizations, which we then convert to
  generalization bounds. Our results do not require any nontrivial assumptions; yet,
  they shed more light to the empirical observations, thanks to the generality of
  the loss functions.
