title: On the Power of Foundation Models
openreview: PVTjHXANRB
abstract: With infinitely many high-quality data points, infinite computational power,
  an infinitely large foundation model with a perfect training algorithm and guaranteed
  zero generalization error on the pretext task, can the model be used for everything?
  This question cannot be answered by the existing theory of representation, optimization
  or generalization, because the issues they mainly investigate are assumed to be
  nonexistent here. In this paper, we show that category theory provides powerful
  machinery to answer this question. We have proved three results. The first one limits
  the power of prompt-based learning, saying that the model can solve a downstream
  task with prompts if and only if the task is representable. The second one says
  fine tuning does not have this limit, as a foundation model with the minimum required
  power (up to symmetry) can theoretically solve downstream tasks for the category
  defined by pretext task, with fine tuning and enough resources. Our final result
  can be seen as a new type of generalization theorem, showing that the foundation
  model can generate unseen objects from the target category (e.g., images) using
  the structural information from the source category (e.g., texts). Along the way,
  we provide a categorical framework for supervised and self-supervised learning,
  which might be of independent interest.
