title: Are Random Decompositions all we need in High Dimensional Bayesian Optimisation?
openreview: LlxkA3u9u8
abstract: Learning decompositions of expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions promises
  to scale Bayesian optimisation (BO) to high-dimensional problems. However, the success
  of these techniques depends on finding proper decompositions that accurately represent
  the black-box. While previous works learn those decompositions based on data, we
  investigate data-independent decomposition sampling rules in this paper. We find
  that data-driven learners of decompositions can be easily misled towards local decompositions
  that do not hold globally across the search space. Then, we formally show that a
  random tree-based decomposition sampler exhibits favourable theoretical guarantees
  that effectively trade off maximal information gain and functional mismatch between
  the actual black-box and its surrogate as provided by the decomposition. Those results
  motivate the development of the random decomposition upper-confidence bound algorithm
  (RDUCB) that is straightforward to implement - (almost) plug-and-play - and, surprisingly,
  yields significant empirical gains compared to the previous state-of-the-art on
  a comprehensive set of benchmarks. We also confirm the plug-and-play nature of our
  modelling component by integrating our method with HEBO, showing improved practical
  gains in the highest dimensional tasks from Bayesmark problem suite.
