title: Online Platt Scaling with Calibeating
openreview: ZXXPQ8GptX
abstract: We present an online post-hoc calibration method, called Online Platt Scaling
  (OPS), which combines the Platt scaling technique with online logistic regression.
  We demonstrate that OPS smoothly adapts between i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings with
  distribution drift. Further, in scenarios where the best Platt scaling model is
  itself miscalibrated, we enhance OPS by incorporating a recently developed technique
  called calibeating to make it more robust. Theoretically, our resulting OPS+calibeating
  method is guaranteed to be calibrated for adversarial outcome sequences. Empirically,
  it is effective on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets, with and without
  distribution drifts, achieving superior performance without hyperparameter tuning.
  Finally, we extend all OPS ideas to the beta scaling method.
