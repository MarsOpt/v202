title: 'Adaptive Identification of Populations with Treatment Benefit in Clinical
  Trials: Machine Learning Challenges and Solutions'
openreview: BGv7lLQVWk
abstract: We study the problem of adaptively identifying patient subpopulations that
  benefit from a given treatment during a confirmatory clinical trial. This type of
  adaptive clinical trial has been thoroughly studied in biostatistics, but has been
  allowed only limited adaptivity so far. Here, we aim to relax classical restrictions
  on such designs and investigate how to incorporate ideas from the recent machine
  learning literature on adaptive and online experimentation to make trials more flexible
  and efficient. We find that the unique characteristics of the subpopulation selection
  problem – most importantly that (i) one is usually interested in finding subpopulations
  with any treatment benefit (and not necessarily the single subgroup with largest
  effect) given a limited budget and that (ii) effectiveness only has to be demonstrated
  across the subpopulation on average – give rise to interesting challenges and new
  desiderata when designing algorithmic solutions. Building on these findings, we
  propose AdaGGI and AdaGCPI, two meta-algorithms for subpopulation construction.
  We empirically investigate their performance across a range of simulation scenarios
  and derive insights into their (dis)advantages across different settings.
