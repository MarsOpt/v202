title: User-defined Event Sampling and Uncertainty Quantification in Diffusion Models
  for Physical Dynamical Systems
openreview: sdhcjMzhHN
abstract: Diffusion models are a class of probabilistic generative models that have
  been widely used as a prior for image processing tasks like text conditional generation
  and inpainting. We demonstrate that these models can be adapted to make predictions
  and provide uncertainty quantification for chaotic dynamical systems. In these applications,
  diffusion models can implicitly represent knowledge about outliers and extreme events;
  however, querying that knowledge through conditional sampling or measuring probabilities
  is surprisingly difficult. Existing methods for conditional sampling at inference
  time seek mainly to enforce the constraints, which is insufficient to match the
  statistics of the distribution or compute the probability of the chosen events.
  To achieve these ends, optimally one would use the conditional score function, but
  its computation is typically intractable. In this work, we develop a probabilistic
  approximation scheme for the conditional score function which provably converges
  to the true distribution as the noise level decreases. With this scheme we are able
  to sample conditionally on nonlinear user-defined events at inference time, and
  matches data statistics even when sampling from the tails of the distribution.
