title: Revisiting Over-smoothing and Over-squashing Using Ollivier-Ricci Curvature
openreview: eWAvwKajx2
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) had been demonstrated to be inherently susceptible
  to the problems of over-smoothing and over-squashing. These issues prohibit the
  ability of GNNs to model complex graph interactions by limiting their effectiveness
  in taking into account distant information. Our study reveals the key connection
  between the local graph geometry and the occurrence of both of these issues, thereby
  providing a unified framework for studying them at a local scale using the Ollivier-Ricci
  curvature. Specifically, we demonstrate that over-smoothing is linked to positive
  graph curvature while over-squashing is linked to negative graph curvature. Based
  on our theory, we propose the Batch Ollivier-Ricci Flow, a novel rewiring algorithm
  capable of simultaneously addressing both over-smoothing and over-squashing.
