title: Contextual Conservative Interleaving Bandits
openreview: 0Rw09XcGS4
abstract: 'The performance of a bandit algorithm is usually measured by the cumulative
  rewards of the actions chosen by the algorithm. However, in many real-world applications,
  the rewards in each round should be good enough for reasons such as safety and fairness.
  In this paper, we investigate the contextual conservative interleaving bandit problem,
  which has a performance constraint that requires the chosen actions to be not much
  worse than given baseline actions in each round. This work is the first to simultaneously
  consider the following practical situations: (1) multiple actions are chosen in
  a round, (2) the feature vectors associated with given actions depend on the round,
  and (3) the performance constraints in each round that depend only on the actions
  chosen in that round. We propose a meta-algorithm, Greedy on Confidence Widths (GCW),
  that satisfies the performance constraints with high probability. GCW uses a standard
  bandit algorithm and achieves minimax optimal regret up to logarithmic factors if
  the algorithm used is also minimax optimal. We improve the existing analyses for
  the C${}^2$UCB algorithm and the Thompson sampling to combine with GCW. We show
  that these algorithms achieve near-optimal regret when the feasible sets of given
  actions are the bases of a matroid. Our numerical experiments on a real-world dataset
  demonstrate that GCW with the standard bandit algorithms efficiently improves performance
  while satisfying the performance constraints.'
