title: Reinforcement Learning Can Be More Efficient with Multiple Rewards
openreview: skDVsmXjPR
abstract: Reward design is one of the most critical and challenging aspects when formulating
  a task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. In practice, it often takes several
  attempts of reward specification and learning with it in order to find one that
  leads to sample-efficient learning of the desired behavior. Instead, in this work,
  we study whether directly incorporating multiple alternate reward formulations of
  the same task in a single agent can lead to faster learning. We analyze multi-reward
  extensions of action-elimination algorithms and prove more favorable instance-dependent
  regret bounds compared to their single-reward counterparts, both in multi-armed
  bandits and in tabular Markov decision processes. Our bounds scale for each state-action
  pair with the inverse of the largest gap among all reward functions. This suggests
  that learning with multiple rewards can indeed be more sample-efficient, as long
  as the rewards agree on an optimal policy. We further prove that when rewards do
  not agree, multi-reward action elimination in multi-armed bandits still learns a
  policy that is good across all reward functions.
