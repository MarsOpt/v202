title: Fairness in Streaming Submodular Maximization over a Matroid Constraint
openreview: KrsaROSs8b
abstract: 'Streaming submodular maximization is a natural model for the task of selecting
  a representative subset from a large-scale dataset. If datapoints have sensitive
  attributes such as gender or race, it becomes important to enforce fairness to avoid
  bias and discrimination. This has spurred significant interest in developing fair
  machine learning algorithms. Recently, such algorithms have been developed for monotone
  submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint. In this paper, we study
  the natural generalization of this problem to a matroid constraint. We give streaming
  algorithms as well as impossibility results that provide trade-offs between efficiency,
  quality and fairness. We validate our findings empirically on a range of well-known
  real-world applications: exemplar-based clustering, movie recommendation, and maximum
  coverage in social networks.'
