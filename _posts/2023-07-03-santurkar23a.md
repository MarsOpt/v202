title: Whose Opinions Do Language Models Reflect?
openreview: 7IRybndMLU
abstract: 'Language models (LMs) are increasingly being used in open-ended contexts,
  where the opinions they reflect in response to subjective queries can have a profound
  impact, both on user satisfaction, and shaping the views of society at large. We
  put forth a quantitative framework to investigate the opinions reflected by LMs
  â€“ by leveraging high-quality public opinion polls. Using this framework, we create
  OpinionQA, a dataset for evaluating the alignment of LM opinions with those of 60
  US demographic groups over topics ranging from abortion to automation. Across topics,
  we find substantial misalignment between the views reflected by current LMs and
  those of US demographic groups: on par with the Democrat-Republican divide on climate
  change. Notably, this misalignment persists even after explicitly steering the LMs
  towards particular groups. Our analysis not only confirms prior observations about
  the left-leaning tendencies of some human feedback-tuned LMs, but also surfaces
  groups whose opinions are poorly reflected by current LMs (e.g., 65+ and widowed
  individuals).'
