title: 'STEERING : Stein Information Directed Exploration for Model-Based Reinforcement
  Learning'
openreview: wbCgv6PdzH
abstract: 'Directed Exploration is a crucial challenge in reinforcement learning (RL),
  especially when rewards are sparse. Information-directed sampling (IDS), which optimizes
  the information ratio, seeks to do so by augmenting regret with information gain.
  However, estimating information gain is computationally intractable or relies on
  restrictive assumptions which prohibit its use in many practical instances. In this
  work, we posit an alternative exploration incentive in terms of the integral probability
  metric (IPM) between a current estimate of the transition model and the unknown
  optimal, which under suitable conditions, can be computed in closed form with the
  kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD). Based on KSD, we develop a novel algorithm STEERING:
  STEin information dirEcted exploration for model-based Reinforcement LearnING. To
  enable its derivation, we develop fundamentally new variants of KSD for discrete
  conditional distributions. We further establish that STEERING archives sublinear
  Bayesian regret, improving upon prior learning rates of information-augmented MBRL,
  IDS included. Experimentally, we show that the proposed algorithm is computationally
  affordable and outperforms several prior approaches.'
