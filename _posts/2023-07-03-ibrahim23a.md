title: Under-Counted Tensor Completion with Neural Incorporation of Attributes
openreview: 5qmc0PoktR
abstract: Systematic under-counting effects are observed in data collected across
  many disciplines, e.g., epidemiology and ecology. Under-counted tensor completion
  (UC-TC) is well-motivated for many data analytics tasks, e.g., inferring the case
  numbers of infectious diseases at unobserved locations from under-counted case numbers
  in neighboring regions. However, existing methods for similar problems often lack
  supports in theory, making it hard to understand the underlying principles and conditions
  beyond empirical successes. In this work, a low-rank Poisson tensor model with an
  expressive unknown nonlinear side information extractor is proposed for under-counted
  multi-aspect data. A joint low-rank tensor completion and neural network learning
  algorithm is designed to recover the model. Moreover, the UC-TC formulation is supported
  by theoretical analysis showing that the fully counted entries of the tensor and
  each entry’s under-counting probability can be provably recovered from partial observations—under
  reasonable conditions. To our best knowledge, the result is the first to offer theoretical
  supports for under-counted multi-aspect data completion. Simulations and real-data
  experiments corroborate the theoretical claims.
