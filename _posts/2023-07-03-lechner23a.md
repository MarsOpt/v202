title: Strategic Classification with Unknown User Manipulations
openreview: staqDHT56I
abstract: In many human-centric applications for Machine Learning instances will adapt
  to a classifier after its deployment. The field of strategic classification deals
  with this issue by aiming for a classifier that balances the trade-off between correctness
  and robustness to manipulation. This task is made harder if the underlying manipulation
  structure (i.e. the set of manipulations available at every instance) is unknown
  to the learner. We propose a novel batch-learning setting in which we use unlabeled
  data from previous rounds to estimate the manipulation structure. We show that in
  this batch-learning setting it is possible to learn a close-to-optimal classifier
  in terms of the strategic loss even without knowing the feasible manipulations beforehand.
  In line with recent advances in the strategic classification literature, we do not
  assume a best-response from agents but only require that observed manipulations
  are feasible.
