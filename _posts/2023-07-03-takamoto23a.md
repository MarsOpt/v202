title: Learning Neural PDE Solvers with Parameter-Guided Channel Attention
openreview: rkBXPvs8s0
abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is concerned with the development of
  learned emulators of physical systems governed by partial differential equations
  (PDE). In application domains such as weather forecasting, molecular dynamics, and
  inverse design, ML-based surrogate models are increasingly used to augment or replace
  inefficient and often non-differentiable numerical simulation algorithms. While
  a number of ML-based methods for approximating the solutions of PDEs have been proposed
  in recent years, they typically do not adapt to the parameters of the PDEs, making
  it difficult to generalize to PDE parameters not seen during training. We propose
  a Channel Attention guided by PDE Parameter Embeddings (CAPE) component for neural
  surrogate models and a simple yet effective curriculum learning strategy. The CAPE
  module can be combined with any neural PDE solvers allowing them to adapt to unseen
  PDE parameters. The curriculum learning strategy provides a seamless transition
  between teacher-forcing and fully auto-regressive training. We compare CAPE in conjunction
  with the curriculum learning strategy using a PDE benchmark and obtain consistent
  and significant improvements over the baseline models. The experiments also show
  several advantages of CAPE, such as its increased ability to generalize to unseen
  PDE parameters without large increases inference time and parameter count. An implementation
  of the method and experiments are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CAPE-ML4Sci-145B.
