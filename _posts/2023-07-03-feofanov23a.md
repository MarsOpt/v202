title: Random Matrix Analysis to Balance between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
  under the Low Density Separation Assumption
openreview: vlGOVmL8uI
abstract: We propose a theoretical framework to analyze semi-supervised classification
  under the low density separation assumption in a high-dimensional regime. In particular,
  we introduce QLDS, a linear classification model, where the low density separation
  assumption is implemented via quadratic margin maximization. The algorithm has an
  explicit solution with rich theoretical properties, and we show that particular
  cases of our algorithm are the least-square support vector machine in the supervised
  case, the spectral clustering in the fully unsupervised regime, and a class of semi-supervised
  graph-based approaches. As such, QLDS establishes a smooth bridge between these
  supervised and unsupervised learning methods. Using recent advances in the random
  matrix theory, we formally derive a theoretical evaluation of the classification
  error in the asymptotic regime. As an application, we derive a hyperparameter selection
  policy that finds the best balance between the supervised and the unsupervised terms
  of our learning criterion. Finally, we provide extensive illustrations of our framework,
  as well as an experimental study on several benchmarks to demonstrate that QLDS,
  while being computationally more efficient, improves over cross-validation for hyperparameter
  selection, indicating a high promise of the usage of random matrix theory for semi-supervised
  model selection.
