title: Coder Reviewer Reranking for Code Generation
openreview: tgXxVlWkmb
abstract: Sampling diverse programs from a code language model and reranking with
  model likelihood is a popular method for code generation but it is prone to preferring
  degenerate solutions. Inspired by collaborative programming, we propose Coder-Reviewer
  reranking. We augment Coder language models from past work, which generate programs
  given language instructions, with Reviewer models, which evaluate the likelihood
  of the instruction given the generated programs. We perform an extensive study across
  six datasets with eight models from three model families. Experimental results show
  that Coder-Reviewer reranking leads to consistent and significant improvement (up
  to 17% absolute accuracy gain) over reranking with the Coder model only. When combined
  with executability filtering, Coder-Reviewer reranking can often outperform the
  minimum Bayes risk method. Coder-Reviewer reranking is easy to implement by prompting,
  can generalize to different programming languages, and works well with off-the-shelf
  hyperparameters.
