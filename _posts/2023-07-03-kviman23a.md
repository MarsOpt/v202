title: 'Cooperation in the Latent Space: The Benefits of Adding Mixture Components
  in Variational Autoencoders'
openreview: 1LwrewdXVJ
abstract: In this paper, we show how the mixture components cooperate when they jointly
  adapt to maximize the ELBO. We build upon recent advances in the multiple and adaptive
  importance sampling literature. We then model the mixture components using separate
  encoder networks and show empirically that the ELBO is monotonically non-decreasing
  as a function of the number of mixture components. These results hold for a range
  of different VAE architectures on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.
  In this work, we also demonstrate that increasing the number of mixture components
  improves the latent-representation capabilities of the VAE on both image and single-cell
  datasets. This cooperative behavior motivates that using Mixture VAEs should be
  considered a standard approach for obtaining more flexible variational approximations.
  Finally, Mixture VAEs are here, for the first time, compared and combined with normalizing
  flows, hierarchical models and/or the VampPrior in an extensive ablation study.
  Multiple of our Mixture VAEs achieve state-of-the-art log-likelihood results for
  VAE architectures on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. The experiments are reproducible
  using our code, provided https://github.com/Lagergren-Lab/MixtureVAEs.
