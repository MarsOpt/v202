title: Regression with Label Permutation in Generalized Linear Model
openreview: bLhaIGkEqc
abstract: The assumption that response and predictor belong to the same statistical
  unit may be violated in practice. Unbiased estimation and recovery of true label
  ordering based on unlabeled data are challenging tasks and have attracted increasing
  attentions in the recent literature. In this paper, we present a relatively complete
  analysis of label permutation problem for the generalized linear model with multivariate
  responses. The theory is established under different scenarios, with knowledge of
  true parameters, with partial knowledge of underlying label permutation matrix and
  without any knowledge. Our results remove the stringent conditions required by the
  current literature and are further extended to the missing observation setting which
  has never been considered in the field of label permutation problem. On computational
  side, we propose two methods, "maximum likelihood estimation" algorithm and "two-step
  estimation" algorithm, to accommodate for different settings. When the proportion
  of permuted labels is moderate, both methods work effectively. Multiple numerical
  experiments are provided and corroborate our theoretical findings.
