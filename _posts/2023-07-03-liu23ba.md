title: 'D2Match: Leveraging Deep Learning and Degeneracy for Subgraph Matching'
openreview: zodnrsrsO7
abstract: Subgraph matching is a fundamental building block for graph-based applications
  and is challenging due to its high-order combinatorial nature. Existing studies
  usually tackle it by combinatorial optimization or learning-based methods. However,
  they suffer from exponential computational costs or searching the matching without
  theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we develop $D^2$Match by leveraging the efficiency
  of Deep learning and Degeneracy for subgraph matching. More specifically, we first
  prove that subgraph matching can degenerate to subtree matching, and subsequently
  is equivalent to finding a perfect matching on a bipartite graph. We can then yield
  an implementation of linear time complexity by the built-in tree-structured aggregation
  mechanism on graph neural networks. Moreover, circle structures and node attributes
  can be easily incorporated in $D^2$Match to boost the matching performance. Finally,
  we conduct extensive experiments to show the superior performance of our $D^2$Match
  and confirm that our $D^2$Match indeed exploits the subtrees and differs from existing
  GNNs-based subgraph matching methods that depend on memorizing the data distribution
  divergence.
