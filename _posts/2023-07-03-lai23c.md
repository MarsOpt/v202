title: 'ChiPFormer: Transferable Chip Placement via Offline Decision Transformer'
openreview: j0miEWtw87
abstract: Placement is a critical step in modern chip design, aiming to determine
  the positions of circuit modules on the chip canvas. Recent works have shown that
  reinforcement learning (RL) can improve human performance in chip placement. However,
  such an RL-based approach suffers from long training time and low transfer ability
  in unseen chip circuits. To resolve these challenges, we cast the chip placement
  as an offline RL formulation and present ChiPFormer that enables learning a transferable
  placement policy from fixed offline data. ChiPFormer has several advantages that
  prior arts do not have. First, ChiPFormer can exploit offline placement designs
  to learn transferable policies more efficiently in a multi-task setting. Second,
  ChiPFormer can promote effective finetuning for unseen chip circuits, reducing the
  placement runtime from hours to minutes. Third, extensive experiments on 32 chip
  circuits demonstrate that ChiPFormer achieves significantly better placement quality
  while reducing the runtime by 10x compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches
  in both public benchmarks and realistic industrial tasks. The deliverables are released
