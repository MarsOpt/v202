title: Fully Dynamic Submodular Maximization over Matroids
openreview: Bj76bauv1Q
abstract: Maximizing monotone submodular functions under a matroid constraint is a
  classic algorithmic problem with multiple applications in data mining and machine
  learning. We study this classic problem in the fully dynamic setting, where elements
  can be both inserted and deleted in real-time. Our main result is a randomized algorithm
  that maintains an efficient data structure with an $\tilde{O}(k^2)$ amortized update
  time (in the number of additions and deletions) and yields a $4$-approximate solution,
  where $k$ is the rank of the matroid.
