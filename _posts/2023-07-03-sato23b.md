title: Existence and Estimation of Critical Batch Size for Training Generative Adversarial
  Networks with Two Time-Scale Update Rule
openreview: 26P1PGCFyc
abstract: Previous results have shown that a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) using
  different learning rates, such as different constant rates or different decaying
  rates, is useful for training generative adversarial networks (GANs) in theory and
  in practice. Moreover, not only the learning rate but also the batch size is important
  for training GANs with TTURs and they both affect the number of steps needed for
  training. This paper studies the relationship between batch size and the number
  of steps needed for training GANs with TTURs based on constant learning rates. We
  theoretically show that, for a TTUR with constant learning rates, the number of
  steps needed to find stationary points of the loss functions of both the discriminator
  and generator decreases as the batch size increases and that there exists a critical
  batch size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. Then,
  we use the Fr√©chet inception distance (FID) as the performance measure for training
  and provide numerical results indicating that the number of steps needed to achieve
  a low FID score decreases as the batch size increases and that the SFO complexity
  increases once the batch size exceeds the measured critical batch size. Moreover,
  we show that measured critical batch sizes are close to the sizes estimated from
  our theoretical results.
