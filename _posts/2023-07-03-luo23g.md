title: Stabilizing GANs’ Training with Brownian Motion Controller
openreview: E8VnTPfIjY
abstract: The training process of generative adversarial networks (GANs) is unstable
  and does not converge globally. In this paper, we examine the stability of GANs
  from the perspective of control theory and propose a universal higher-order noise-based
  controller called Brownian Motion Controller (BMC). Starting with the prototypical
  case of Dirac-GANs, we design a BMC to retrieve precisely the same but reachable
  optimal equilibrium. We theoretically prove that the training process of DiracGANs-BMC
  is globally exponential stable and derive bounds on the rate of convergence. Then
  we extend our BMC to normal GANs and provide implementation instructions on GANs-BMC.
  Our experiments show that our GANs-BMC effectively stabilizes GANs’ training under
  StyleGANv2-ada frameworks with a faster rate of convergence, a smaller range of
  oscillation, and better performance in terms of FID score.
