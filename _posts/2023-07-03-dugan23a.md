title: 'Q-Flow: Generative Modeling for Differential Equations of Open Quantum Dynamics
  with Normalizing Flows'
openreview: 6rqa493Sxf
abstract: Studying the dynamics of open quantum systems can enable breakthroughs both
  in fundamental physics and applications to quantum engineering and quantum computation.
  Since the density matrix $\rho$, which is the fundamental description for the dynamics
  of such systems, is high-dimensional, customized deep generative neural networks
  have been instrumental in modeling $\rho$. However, the complex-valued nature and
  normalization constraints of $\rho$, as well as its complicated dynamics, prohibit
  a seamless connection between open quantum systems and the recent advances in deep
  generative modeling. Here we lift that limitation by utilizing a reformulation of
  open quantum system dynamics to a partial differential equation (PDE) for a corresponding
  probability distribution $Q$, the Husimi Q function. Thus, we model the Q function
  seamlessly with <em>off-the-shelf</em> deep generative models such as normalizing
  flows. Additionally, we develop novel methods for learning normalizing flow evolution
  governed by high-dimensional PDEs based on the Euler method and the application
  of the time-dependent variational principle. We name the resulting approach <em>Q-Flow</em>
  and demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of Q-Flow on open quantum system
  simulations, including the dissipative harmonic oscillator and the dissipative bosonic
  model. Q-Flow is superior to conventional PDE solvers and state-of-the-art physics-informed
  neural network solvers, especially in high-dimensional systems.
