title: 'Feed Two Birds with One Scone: Exploiting Wild Data for Both Out-of-Distribution
  Generalization and Detection'
openreview: 3FydczZwkJ
abstract: Modern machine learning models deployed in the wild can encounter both covariate
  and semantic shifts, giving rise to the problems of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization
  and OOD detection respectively. While both problems have received significant research
  attention lately, they have been pursued independently. This may not be surprising,
  since the two tasks have seemingly conflicting goals. This paper provides a new
  unified approach that is capable of simultaneously generalizing to covariate shifts
  while robustly detecting semantic shifts. We propose a margin-based learning framework
  that exploits freely available unlabeled data in the wild that captures the environmental
  test-time OOD distributions under both covariate and semantic shifts. We show both
  empirically and theoretically that the proposed margin constraint is the key to
  achieving both OOD generalization and detection. Extensive experiments show the
  superiority of our framework, outperforming competitive baselines that specialize
  in either OOD generalization or OOD detection. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/scone.
