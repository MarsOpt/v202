title: Image Restoration with Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equations
openreview: IOVYTyoqVz
abstract: This paper presents a stochastic differential equation (SDE) approach for
  general-purpose image restoration. The key construction consists in a mean-reverting
  SDE that transforms a high-quality image into a degraded counterpart as a mean state
  with fixed Gaussian noise. Then, by simulating the corresponding reverse-time SDE,
  we are able to restore the origin of the low-quality image without relying on any
  task-specific prior knowledge. Crucially, the proposed mean-reverting SDE has a
  closed-form solution, allowing us to compute the ground truth time-dependent score
  and learn it with a neural network. Moreover, we propose a maximum likelihood objective
  to learn an optimal reverse trajectory that stabilizes the training and improves
  the restoration results. The experiments show that our proposed method achieves
  highly competitive performance in quantitative comparisons on image deraining, deblurring,
  and denoising, setting a new state-of-the-art on two deraining datasets. Finally,
  the general applicability of our approach is further demonstrated via qualitative
  results on image super-resolution, inpainting, and dehazing. Code is available at
