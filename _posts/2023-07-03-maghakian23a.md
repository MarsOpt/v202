title: Applied Online Algorithms with Heterogeneous Predictors
openreview: wHmP0NGVd9
abstract: For many application domains, the integration of machine learning (ML) models
  into decision making is hindered by the poor explainability and theoretical guarantees
  of black box models. Although the emerging area of algorithms with predictions offers
  a way to leverage ML while enjoying worst-case guarantees, existing work usually
  assumes access to only one predictor. We demonstrate how to more effectively utilize
  historical datasets and application domain knowledge by intentionally using predictors
  of <em>different</em> quantities. By leveraging the heterogeneity in our predictors,
  we are able to achieve improved performance, explainability and computational efficiency
  over predictor-agnostic methods. Theoretical results are supplemented by large-scale
  empirical evaluations with production data demonstrating the success of our methods
  on optimization problems occurring in large distributed computing systems.
