title: Entity Divider with Language Grounding in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
openreview: fXBjFPL5HD
abstract: We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of
  policies in multi-agent settings. Unlike single-agent settings, the generalization
  of policies should also consider the influence of other agents. Besides, with the
  increasing number of entities in multi-agent settings, more agent-entity interactions
  are needed for language grounding, and the enormous search space could impede the
  learning process. Moreover, given a simple general instruction, e.g., beating all
  enemies, agents are required to decompose it into multiple subgoals and figure out
  the right one to focus on. Inspired by previous work, we try to address these issues
  at the entity level and propose a novel framework for language grounding in multi-agent
  reinforcement learning, entity divider (EnDi). EnDi enables agents to independently
  learn subgoal division at the entity level and act in the environment based on the
  associated entities. The subgoal division is regularized by agent modeling to avoid
  subgoal conflicts and promote coordinated strategies. Empirically, EnDi demonstrates
  the strong generalization ability to unseen games with new dynamics and expresses
  the superiority over existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/EnDi.
