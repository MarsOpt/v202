title: Representations and Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning using Singular
  Value Decomposition
openreview: p9wFuLpp0O
abstract: Representation learning and exploration are among the key challenges for
  any deep reinforcement learning agent. In this work, we provide a singular value
  decomposition based method that can be used to obtain representations that preserve
  the underlying transition structure in the domain. Perhaps interestingly, we show
  that these representations also capture the relative frequency of state visitations,
  thereby providing an estimate for pseudo-counts for free. To scale this decomposition
  method to large-scale domains, we provide an algorithm that never requires building
  the transition matrix, can make use of deep networks, and also permits mini-batch
  training. Further, we draw inspiration from predictive state representations and
  extend our decomposition method to partially observable environments. With experiments
  on multi-task settings with partially observable domains, we show that the proposed
  method can not only learn useful representation on DM-Lab-30 environments (that
  have inputs involving language instructions, pixel images, rewards, among others)
  but it can also be effective at hard exploration tasks in DM-Hard-8 environments.
