title: 'Prometheus: Taming Sample and Communication Complexities in Constrained Decentralized
  Stochastic Bilevel Learning'
openreview: KDSoOxHH0D
abstract: In recent years, decentralized bilevel optimization has gained significant
  attention thanks to its versatility in modeling a wide range of multi-agent learning
  problems, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning and multi-agent meta-learning.
  However, one unexplored and fundamental problem in this area is how to solve decentralized
  stochastic bilevel optimization problems with <b>domain constraints</b> while achieving
  low sample and communication complexities. This problem often arises from multi-agent
  learning problems with safety constraints. As shown in this paper, constrained decentralized
  bilevel optimization is far more challenging than its unconstrained counterpart
  due to the complex coupling structure, which necessitates new algorithm design and
  analysis techniques. Toward this end, we investigate a class of constrained decentralized
  bilevel optimization problems, where multiple agents collectively solve a nonconvex-strongly-convex
  bilevel problem with constraints in the upper-level variables. We propose an algorithm
  called Prometheus (proximal tracked stochastic recursive estimator) that achieves
  the first $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ results in both sample and communication
  complexities for constrained decentralized bilevel optimization, where $\epsilon>0$
  is a desired stationarity error. Collectively, the results in this work contribute
  to a theoretical foundation for low sample- and communication-complexity constrained
  decentralized bilevel learning.
