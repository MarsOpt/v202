title: Adversarial Parameter Attack on Deep Neural Networks
openreview: fdbDDRhPGi
abstract: The parameter perturbation attack is a safety threat to deep learning, where
  small parameter perturbations are made such that the attacked network gives wrong
  or desired labels of the adversary to specified inputs. However, such attacks could
  be detected by the user, because the accuracy of the attacked network will reduce
  and the network cannot work normally. To make the attack more stealthy, in this
  paper, the adversarial parameter attack is proposed, in which small perturbations
  to the parameters of the network are made such that the accuracy of the attacked
  network does not decrease much, but its robustness against adversarial example attacks
  becomes much lower. As a consequence, the attacked network performs normally on
  standard samples, but is much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The existence
  of nearly perfect adversarial parameters under $L_\infty$ norm and $L_0$ norm is
  proved under reasonable conditions. Algorithms are given which can be used to produce
  high quality adversarial parameters for the commonly used networks trained with
  various robust training methods, in that the robustness of the attacked networks
  decreases significantly when they are evaluated using various adversarial attack
  methods.
