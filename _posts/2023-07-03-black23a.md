title: Understanding Oversquashing in GNNs through the Lens of Effective Resistance
openreview: 50SO1LwcYU
abstract: Message passing graph neural networks (GNNs) are a popular learning architectures
  for graph-structured data. However, one problem GNNs experience is oversquashing,
  where a GNN has difficulty sending information between distant nodes. Understanding
  and mitigating oversquashing has recently received significant attention from the
  research community. In this paper, we continue this line of work by analyzing oversquashing
  through the lens of the <em>effective resistance</em> between nodes in the input
  graph. Effective resistance intuitively captures the “strength” of connection between
  two nodes by paths in the graph, and has a rich literature spanning many areas of
  graph theory. We propose to use <em>total effective resistance</em> as a bound of
  the total amount of oversquashing in a graph and provide theoretical justification
  for its use. We further develop an algorithm to identify edges to be added to an
  input graph to minimize the total effective resistance, thereby alleviating oversquashing.
  We provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our total effective resistance
  based rewiring strategies for improving the performance of GNNs.
