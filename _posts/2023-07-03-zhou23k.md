title: Fast Online Node Labeling for Very Large Graphs
openreview: p6T3omuNZK
abstract: This paper studies the online node classification problem under a transductive
  learning setting. Current methods either invert a graph kernel matrix with $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$
  runtime and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ space complexity or sample a large volume of random
  spanning trees, thus are difficult to scale to large graphs. In this work, we propose
  an improvement based on the <em>online relaxation</em> technique introduced by a
  series of works (Rakhlin et al., 2012; Rakhlin & Sridharan, 2015; 2017). We first
  prove an effective regret $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n^{1+\gamma}})$ when suitable parameterized
  graph kernels are chosen, then propose an approximate algorithm FastONL enjoying
  $\mathcal{O}(k\sqrt{n^{1+\gamma}})$ regret based on this relaxation. The key of
  FastONL is a <em>generalized local push</em> method that effectively approximates
  inverse matrix columns and applies to a series of popular kernels. Furthermore,
  the per-prediction cost is $\mathcal{O}(\operatorname{vol}{\mathcal{S}}\log 1/\epsilon)$
  locally dependent on the graph with linear memory cost. Experiments show that our
  scalable method enjoys a better tradeoff between local and global consistency.
