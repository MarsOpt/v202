title: Graph Inductive Biases in Transformers without Message Passing
openreview: HjMdlNgybR
abstract: 'Transformers for graph data are increasingly widely studied and successful
  in numerous learning tasks. Graph inductive biases are crucial for Graph Transformers,
  and previous works incorporate them using message-passing modules and/or positional
  encodings. However, Graph Transformers that use message-passing inherit known issues
  of message-passing, and differ significantly from Transformers used in other domains,
  thus making transfer of research advances more difficult. On the other hand, Graph
  Transformers without message-passing often perform poorly on smaller datasets, where
  inductive biases are more crucial. To bridge this gap, we propose the Graph Inductive
  bias Transformer (GRIT) — a new Graph Transformer that incorporates graph inductive
  biases without using message passing. GRIT is based on several architectural changes
  that are each theoretically and empirically justified, including: learned relative
  positional encodings initialized with random walk probabilities, a flexible attention
  mechanism that updates node and node-pair representations, and injection of degree
  information in each layer. We prove that GRIT is expressive — it can express shortest
  path distances and various graph propagation matrices. GRIT achieves state-of-the-art
  empirical performance across a variety of graph datasets, thus showing the power
  that Graph Transformers without message-passing can deliver.'
