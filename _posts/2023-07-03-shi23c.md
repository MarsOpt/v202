title: A Near-Optimal Algorithm for Safe Reinforcement Learning Under Instantaneous
  Hard Constraints
openreview: 3HMO9iSBdy
abstract: In many applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is critically important
  that the algorithm performs safely, such that instantaneous hard constraints are
  satisfied at each step, and unsafe states and actions are avoided. However, existing
  algorithms for “safe” RL are often designed under constraints that either require
  expected cumulative costs to be bounded or assume all states are safe. Thus, such
  algorithms could violate instantaneous hard constraints and traverse unsafe states
  (and actions) in practice. Hence, in this paper, we develop the first near-optimal
  safe RL algorithm for episodic Markov Decision Processes with unsafe states and
  actions under instantaneous hard constraints and the linear mixture model. It achieves
  a regret $\tilde{O}(\frac{d H^3 \sqrt{d K}}{\Delta_c})$ that nearly matches the
  state-of-the-art regret in the setting with only unsafe actions and that in the
  unconstrained setting, and is safe at each step, where $d$ is the feature-mapping
  dimension, $K$ is the number of episodes, $H$ is the episode length, and $\Delta_c$
  is a safety-related parameter. We also provide a lower bound $\tilde{\Omega}(\max\{d
  H \sqrt{K}, \frac{H}{\Delta_c^2}\})$, which indicates that the dependency on $\Delta_c$
  is necessary. Further, both our algorithm design and regret analysis involve several
  novel ideas, which may be of independent interest.
