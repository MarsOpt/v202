title: 'SAAL: Sharpness-Aware Active Learning'
openreview: UuyexSGIqR
abstract: While deep neural networks play significant roles in many research areas,
  they are also prone to overfitting problems under limited data instances. To overcome
  overfitting, this paper introduces the first active learning method to incorporate
  the sharpness of loss space into the acquisition function. Specifically, our proposed
  method, Sharpness-Aware Active Learning (SAAL), constructs its acquisition function
  by selecting unlabeled instances whose perturbed loss becomes maximum. Unlike the
  Sharpness-Aware learning with fully-labeled datasets, we design a pseudo-labeling
  mechanism to anticipate the perturbed loss w.r.t. the ground-truth label, which
  we provide the theoretical bound for the optimization. We conduct experiments on
  various benchmark datasets for vision-based tasks in image classification, object
  detection, and domain adaptive semantic segmentation. The experimental results confirm
  that SAAL outperforms the baselines by selecting instances that have the potentially
  maximal perturbation on the loss. The code is available at https://github.com/YoonyeongKim/SAAL.
