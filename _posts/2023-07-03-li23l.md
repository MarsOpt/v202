title: 'Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning'
openreview: CgB7wCExOF
abstract: 'In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model
  operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly.
  In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem
  where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time.
  We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of
  multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt
  is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from
  a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the
  stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when
  transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also
  provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify
  an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by
  the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner.
  Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can
  indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d.
  and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical
  predictions.'
