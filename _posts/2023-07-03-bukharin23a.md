title: Machine Learning Force Fields with Data Cost Aware Training
openreview: HODGKcJ3ul
abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFF) have been proposed to accelerate molecular
  dynamics (MD) simulation, which finds widespread applications in chemistry and biomedical
  research. Even for the most data-efficient MLFFs, reaching chemical accuracy can
  require hundreds of frames of force and energy labels generated by expensive quantum
  mechanical algorithms, which may scale as $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^7)$, with $n$ proportional
  to the number of basis functions. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage
  computational framework – ASTEROID, which lowers the data cost of MLFFs by leveraging
  a combination of cheap inaccurate data and expensive accurate data. The motivation
  behind ASTEROID is that inaccurate data, though incurring large bias, can help capture
  the sophisticated structures of the underlying force field. Therefore, we first
  train a MLFF model on a large amount of inaccurate training data, employing a bias-aware
  loss function to prevent the model from overfitting the potential bias of this data.
  We then fine-tune the obtained model using a small amount of accurate training data,
  which preserves the knowledge learned from the inaccurate training data while significantly
  improving the model’s accuracy. Moreover, we propose a variant of ASTEROID based
  on score matching for the setting where the inaccurate training data are unlabeled.
  Extensive experiments on MD datasets and downstream tasks validate the efficacy
  of ASTEROID. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/abukharin3/asteroid.
