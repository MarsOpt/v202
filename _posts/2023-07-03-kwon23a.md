title: Rotation and Translation Invariant Representation Learning with Implicit Neural
  Representations
openreview: g2IkXyv6ro
abstract: In many computer vision applications, images are acquired with arbitrary
  or random rotations and translations, and in such setups, it is desirable to obtain
  semantic representations disentangled from the image orientation. Examples of such
  applications include semiconductor wafer defect inspection, plankton microscope
  images, and inference on single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) micro-graphs.
  In this work, we propose Invariant Representation Learning with Implicit Neural
  Representation (IRL-INR), which uses an implicit neural representation (INR) with
  a hypernetwork to obtain semantic representations disentangled from the orientation
  of the image. We show that IRL-INR can effectively learn disentangled semantic representations
  on more complex images compared to those considered in prior works and show that
  these semantic representations synergize well with SCAN to produce state-of-the-art
  unsupervised clustering results.
