title: Improved Algorithms for White-Box Adversarial Streams
openreview: 7EvberozFP
abstract: We study streaming algorithms in the white-box adversarial stream model,
  where the internal state of the streaming algorithm is revealed to an adversary
  who adaptively generates the stream updates, but the algorithm obtains fresh randomness
  unknown to the adversary at each time step. We incorporate cryptographic assumptions
  to construct robust algorithms against such adversaries. We propose efficient algorithms
  for sparse recovery of vectors, low rank recovery of matrices and tensors, as well
  as low rank plus sparse recovery of matrices, i.e., robust PCA. Unlike deterministic
  algorithms, our algorithms can report when the input is not sparse or low rank even
  in the presence of such an adversary. We use these recovery algorithms to improve
  upon and solve new problems in numerical linear algebra and combinatorial optimization
  on white-box adversarial streams. For example, we give the first efficient algorithm
  for outputting a matching in a graph with insertions and deletions to its edges
  provided the matching size is small, and otherwise we declare the matching size
  is large. We also improve the approximation versus memory tradeoff of previous work
  for estimating the number of non-zero elements in a vector and computing the matrix
  rank.
