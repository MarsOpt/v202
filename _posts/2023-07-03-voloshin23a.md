title: Eventual Discounting Temporal Logic Counterfactual Experience Replay
openreview: wCy3pef6kA
abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a simplified way of specifying tasks
  for policy optimization that may otherwise be difficult to describe with scalar
  reward functions. However, the standard RL framework can be too myopic to find maximally
  LTL satisfying policies. This paper makes two contributions. First, we develop a
  new value-function based proxy, using a technique we call eventual discounting,
  under which one can find policies that satisfy the LTL specification with highest
  achievable probability. Second, we develop a new experience replay method for generating
  off-policy data from on-policy rollouts via counterfactual reasoning on different
  ways of satisfying the LTL specification. Our experiments, conducted in both discrete
  and continuous state-action spaces, confirm the effectiveness of our counterfactual
  experience replay approach.
