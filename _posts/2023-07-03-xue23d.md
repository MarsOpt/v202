title: Which Features are Learnt by Contrastive Learning? On the Role of Simplicity
  Bias in Class Collapse and Feature Suppression
openreview: 0BS36re3Cx
abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful technique for representation
  learning, with or without label supervision. However, supervised CL is prone to
  collapsing representations of subclasses within a class by not capturing all their
  features, and unsupervised CL may suppress harder class-relevant features by focusing
  on learning easy class-irrelevant features; both significantly compromise representation
  quality. Yet, there is no theoretical understanding of <em>class collapse</em> or
  <em>feature suppression</em> at <em>test</em> time. We provide the first unified
  theoretically rigorous framework to determine <em>which</em> features are learnt
  by CL. Our analysis indicate that, perhaps surprisingly, bias of (stochastic) gradient
  descent towards finding simpler solutions is a key factor in collapsing subclass
  representations and suppressing harder class-relevant features. Moreover, we present
  increasing embedding dimensionality and improving the quality of data augmentations
  as two theoretically motivated solutions to feature suppression. We also provide
  the first theoretical explanation for why employing supervised and unsupervised
  CL together yields higher-quality representations, even when using commonly-used
  stochastic gradient methods.
