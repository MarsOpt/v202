title: Difference of submodular minimization via DC programming
openreview: e1lKKjkNMj
abstract: 'Minimizing the difference of two submodular (DS) functions is a problem
  that naturally occurs in various machine learning problems. Although it is well
  known that a DS problem can be equivalently formulated as the minimization of the
  difference of two convex (DC) functions, existing algorithms do not fully exploit
  this connection. A classical algorithm for DC problems is called the DC algorithm
  (DCA). We introduce variants of DCA and its complete form (CDCA) that we apply to
  the DC program corresponding to DS minimization. We extend existing convergence
  properties of DCA, and connect them to convergence properties on the DS problem.
  Our results on DCA match the theoretical guarantees satisfied by existing DS algorithms,
  while providing a more complete characterization of convergence properties. In the
  case of CDCA, we obtain a stronger local minimality guarantee. Our numerical results
  show that our proposed algorithms outperform existing baselines on two applications:
  speech corpus selection and feature selection.'
