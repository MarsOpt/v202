title: Towards Understanding and Reducing Graph Structural Noise for GNNs
openreview: wO6ExWRO3c
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm to learn
  from relational data mostly through applying the message passing mechanism. However,
  this approach may exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to graphs possessing
  various structural issues. In this work, we focus on understanding and alleviating
  the effect of graph structural noise on GNN performance. To evaluate the graph structural
  noise in real data, we propose edge signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR), a novel metric
  evaluating overall edge noise level with respect to data features or labels based
  on random matrix theory. We have found striking concordance between the proposed
  ESNR metric and the GNN performance in various simulated and real data. To reduce
  the effect of the noise, we propose GPS (Graph Propensity Score) graph rewiring,
  which estimates the edge likelihood for rewiring data graphs based on self-supervised
  link prediction. We provide a theoretical guarantee for GPS graph rewiring and demonstrate
  its efficacy by comprehensive benchmarks.
