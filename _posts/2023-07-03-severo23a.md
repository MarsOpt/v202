title: One-Shot Compression of Large Edge-Exchangeable Graphs using Bits-Back Coding
openreview: 9L6f6Y7GUS
abstract: We present a one-shot method for compressing large labeled graphs called
  Random Edge Coding. When paired with a parameter-free model based on Pólya’s Urn,
  the worst-case computational and memory complexities scale quasi-linearly and linearly
  with the number of observed edges, making it efficient on sparse graphs, and requires
  only integer arithmetic. Key to our method is bits-back coding, which is used to
  sample edges and vertices without replacement from the edge-list in a way that preserves
  the structure of the graph. Optimality is proven under a class of random graph models
  that are invariant to permutations of the edges and of vertices within an edge.
  Experiments indicate Random Edge Coding can achieve competitive compression performance
  on real-world network datasets and scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges.
