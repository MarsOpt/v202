title: 'TR0N: Translator Networks for 0-Shot Plug-and-Play Conditional Generation'
openreview: kgXNDkztdJ
abstract: We propose TR0N, a highly general framework to turn pre-trained unconditional
  generative models, such as GANs and VAEs, into conditional models. The conditioning
  can be highly arbitrary, and requires only a pre-trained auxiliary model. For example,
  we show how to turn unconditional models into class-conditional ones with the help
  of a classifier, and also into text-to-image models by leveraging CLIP. TR0N learns
  a lightweight stochastic mapping which "translates’" between the space of conditions
  and the latent space of the generative model, in such a way that the generated latent
  corresponds to a data sample satisfying the desired condition. The translated latent
  samples are then further improved upon through Langevin dynamics, enabling us to
  obtain higher-quality data samples. TR0N requires no training data nor fine-tuning,
  yet can achieve a zero-shot FID of 10.9 on MS-COCO, outperforming competing alternatives
  not only on this metric, but also in sampling speed – all while retaining a much
  higher level of generality. Our code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/tr0n.
