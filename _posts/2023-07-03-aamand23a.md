title: Data Structures for Density Estimation
openreview: BVomXLJQoH
abstract: 'We study statistical/computational tradeoffs for the following density
  estimation problem: given $k$ distributions $v_1, \ldots, v_k$ over a discrete domain
  of size $n$, and sampling access to a distribution $p$, identify $v_i$ that is "close"
  to $p$. Our main result is the first data structure that, given a sublinear (in
  $n$) number of samples from $p$, identifies $v_i$ in time sublinear in $k$. We also
  give an improved version of the algorithm of Acharya et al. (2018) that reports
  $v_i$ in time linear in $k$. The experimental evaluation of the latter algorithm
  shows that it achieves a significant reduction in the number of operations needed
  to achieve a given accuracy compared to prior work.'
