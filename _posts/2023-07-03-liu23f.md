title: 'AudioLDM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Diffusion Models'
openreview: 6BhipYkaSV
abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) systems have recently gained attention for their ability
  to synthesize general audio based on text descriptions. However, previous studies
  in TTA have limited generation quality with high computational costs. In this study,
  we propose AudioLDM, a TTA system that is built on a latent space to learn continuous
  audio representations from contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) embeddings.
  The pretrained CLAP models enable us to train LDMs with audio embeddings while providing
  text embeddings as the condition during sampling. By learning the latent representations
  of audio signals without modelling the cross-modal relationship, AudioLDM improves
  both generation quality and computational efficiency. Trained on AudioCaps with
  a single GPU, AudioLDM achieves state-of-the-art TTA performance compared to other
  open-sourced systems, measured by both objective and subjective metrics. AudioLDM
  is also the first TTA system that enables various text-guided audio manipulations
  (e.g., style transfer) in a zero-shot fashion. Our implementation and demos are
  available at https://audioldm.github.io.
