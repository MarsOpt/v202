title: Deep Graph Representation Learning and Optimization for Influence Maximization
openreview: 4k8cvbQJh8
abstract: Influence maximization (IM) is formulated as selecting a set of initial
  users from a social network to maximize the expected number of influenced users.
  Researchers have made great progresses to design various traditional methods, yet
  both theoretical design and performance gain are close to their limits. In the past
  few years, learning-based IM methods have emerged to achieve stronger generalization
  ability to unknown graphs than traditional ones. However, the development of learning-based
  IM methods is still limited by fundamental obstacles, including 1) the difficulty
  of effectively solving the objective function; 2) the difficulty of characterizing
  the diversified and underlying diffusion patterns; and 3) the difficulty of adapting
  the solution under various node-centrality-constrained IM variants. To cope with
  the above challenges, we design a novel framework DeepIM to generatively characterize
  the latent representation of seed sets, and we propose to learn the diversified
  information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end manner. Finally, we
  design a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based
  budget constraints. Extensive analyses are conducted over both synthetic and real-world
  datasets to demonstrate the overall performance of DeepIM.
