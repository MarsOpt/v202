title: Distilling Internet-Scale Vision-Language Models into Embodied Agents
openreview: 6vVkGnEpP7
abstract: Instruction-following agents must ground language into their observation
  and action spaces. Learning to ground language is challenging, typically requiring
  domain-specific engineering or large quantities of human interaction data. To address
  this challenge, we propose using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to supervise
  embodied agents. We combine ideas from model distillation and hindsight experience
  replay (HER), using a VLM to retroactively generate language describing the agentâ€™s
  behavior. Simple prompting allows us to control the supervision signal, teaching
  an agent to interact with novel objects based on their names (e.g., planes) or their
  features (e.g., colors) in a 3D rendered environment. Fewshot prompting lets us
  teach abstract category membership, including pre-existing categories (food vs toys)
  and ad-hoc ones (arbitrary preferences over objects). Our work outlines a new and
  effective way to use internet-scale VLMs, repurposing the generic language grounding
  acquired by such models to teach task-relevant groundings to embodied agents.
