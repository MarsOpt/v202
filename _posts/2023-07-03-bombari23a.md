title: 'Beyond the Universal Law of Robustness: Sharper Laws for Random Features and
  Neural Tangent Kernels'
openreview: fZFNPf1QiF
abstract: 'Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and
  a thought-provoking paper by Bubeck and Sellke has analyzed this phenomenon through
  the lens of over-parameterization: interpolating smoothly the data requires significantly
  more parameters than simply memorizing it. However, this "universal" law provides
  only a necessary condition for robustness, and it is unable to discriminate between
  models. In this paper, we address these gaps by focusing on empirical risk minimization
  in two prototypical settings, namely, random features and the neural tangent kernel
  (NTK). We prove that, for random features, the model is not robust for any degree
  of over-parameterization, even when the necessary condition coming from the universal
  law of robustness is satisfied. In contrast, for even activations, the NTK model
  meets the universal lower bound, and it is robust as soon as the necessary condition
  on over-parameterization is fulfilled. This also addresses a conjecture in prior
  work by Bubeck, Li and Nagaraj. Our analysis decouples the effect of the kernel
  of the model from an "interaction matrix", which describes the interaction with
  the test data and captures the effect of the activation. Our theoretical results
  are corroborated by numerical evidence on both synthetic and standard datasets (MNIST,
  CIFAR-10).'
