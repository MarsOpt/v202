title: Probably Anytime-Safe Stochastic Combinatorial Semi-Bandits
openreview: 14fSjJyJAR
abstract: Motivated by concerns about making online decisions that incur undue amount
  of risk at each time step, in this paper, we formulate the probably anytime-safe
  stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits problem. In this problem, the agent is given
  the option to select a subset of size at most $K$ from a set of $L$ ground items.
  Each item is associated to a certain mean reward as well as a variance that represents
  its risk. To mitigate the risk that the agent incurs, we require that with probability
  at least $1-\delta$, over the entire horizon of time $T$, each of the choices that
  the agent makes should contain items whose sum of variances does not exceed a certain
  variance budget. We call this probably anytime-safe constraint. Under this constraint,
  we design and analyze an algorithm PASCombUCB that minimizes the regret over the
  horizon of time $T$. By developing accompanying information-theoretic lower bounds,
  we show that under both the problem-dependent and problem-independent paradigms,
  PASCombUCB is almost asymptotically optimal. Experiments are conducted to corroborate
  our theoretical findings. Our problem setup, the proposed PASCombUCB algorithm,
  and novel analyses are applicable to domains such as recommendation systems and
  transportation in which an agent is allowed to choose multiple items at a single
  time step and wishes to control the risk over the whole time horizon.
