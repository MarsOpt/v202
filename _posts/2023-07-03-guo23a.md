title: Privacy-Aware Compression for Federated Learning Through Numerical Mechanism
  Design
openreview: Otdp5SGQMr
abstract: In private federated learning (FL), a server aggregates differentially private
  updates from a large number of clients in order to train a machine learning model.
  The main challenge in this setting is balancing privacy with both classification
  accuracy of the learnt model as well as the number of bits communicated between
  the clients and server. Prior work has achieved a good trade-off by designing a
  privacy-aware compression mechanism, called the minimum variance unbiased (MVU)
  mechanism, that numerically solves an optimization problem to determine the parameters
  of the mechanism. This paper builds upon it by introducing a new interpolation procedure
  in the numerical design process that allows for a far more efficient privacy analysis.
  The result is the new Interpolated MVU mechanism that is more scalable, has a better
  privacy-utility trade-off, and provides SOTA results on communication-efficient
  private FL on a variety of datasets.
