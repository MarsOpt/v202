title: Synthetic data for model selection
openreview: QwFkJ3QVii
abstract: Recent breakthroughs in synthetic data generation approaches made it possible
  to produce highly photorealistic images which are hardly distinguishable from real
  ones. Furthermore, synthetic generation pipelines have the potential to generate
  an unlimited number of images. The combination of high photorealism and scale turn
  synthetic data into a promising candidate for improving various machine learning
  (ML) pipelines. Thus far, a large body of research in this field has focused on
  using synthetic images for training, by augmenting and enlarging training data.
  In contrast to using synthetic data for training, in this work we explore whether
  synthetic data can be beneficial for model selection. Considering the task of image
  classification, we demonstrate that when data is scarce, synthetic data can be used
  to replace the held out validation set, thus allowing to train on a larger dataset.
  We also introduce a novel method to calibrate the synthetic error estimation to
  fit that of the real domain. We show that such calibration significantly improves
  the usefulness of synthetic data for model selection.
