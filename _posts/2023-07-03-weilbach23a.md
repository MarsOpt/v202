title: Graphically Structured Diffusion Models
openreview: 24wzmwrldX
abstract: We introduce a framework for automatically defining and learning deep generative
  models with problem-specific structure. We tackle problem domains that are more
  traditionally solved by algorithms such as sorting, constraint satisfaction for
  Sudoku, and matrix factorization. Concretely, we train diffusion models with an
  architecture tailored to the problem specification. This problem specification should
  contain a graphical model describing relationships between variables, and often
  benefits from explicit representation of subcomputations. Permutation invariances
  can also be exploited. Across a diverse set of experiments we improve the scaling
  relationship between problem dimension and our modelâ€™s performance, in terms of
  both training time and final accuracy. Our code can be found at https://github.com/plai-group/gsdm.
