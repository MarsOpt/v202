title: Controlling Type Confounding in Ad Hoc Teamwork with Instance-wise Teammate
  Feedback Rectification
openreview: OuNhPgThxP
abstract: Ad hoc teamwork requires an agent to cooperate with unknown teammates without
  prior coordination. Many works propose to abstract teammate instances into high-level
  representation of types and then pre-train the best response for each type. However,
  most of them do not consider the distribution of teammate instances within a type.
  This could expose the agent to the hidden risk of type confounding. In the worst
  case, the best response for an abstract teammate type could be the worst response
  for all specific instances of that type. This work addresses the issue from the
  lens of causal inference. We first theoretically demonstrate that this phenomenon
  is due to the spurious correlation brought by uncontrolled teammate distribution.
  Then, we propose our solution, CTCAT, which disentangles such correlation through
  an instance-wise teammate feedback rectification. This operation reweights the interaction
  of teammate instances within a shared type to reduce the influence of type confounding.
  The effect of CTCAT is evaluated in multiple domains, including classic ad hoc teamwork
  tasks and real-world scenarios. Results show that CTCAT is robust to the influence
  of type confounding, a practical issue that directly hazards the robustness of our
  trained agents but was unnoticed in previous works.
