title: 'Dividing and Conquering a BlackBox to a Mixture of Interpretable Models: Route,
  Interpret, Repeat'
openreview: 0SgBUsL4W0
abstract: ML model design either starts with an interpretable model or a Blackbox
  and explains it post hoc. Blackbox models are flexible but difficult to explain,
  while interpretable models are inherently explainable. Yet, interpretable models
  require extensive ML knowledge and tend to be less flexible, potentially underperforming
  than their Blackbox equivalents. This paper aims to blur the distinction between
  a post hoc explanation of a Blackbox and constructing interpretable models. Beginning
  with a Blackbox, we iteratively <em>carve out</em> a mixture of interpretable models
  and a <em>residual network</em>. The interpretable models identify a subset of samples
  and explain them using First Order Logic (FOL), providing basic reasoning on concepts
  from the Blackbox. We route the remaining samples through a flexible residual. We
  repeat the method on the residual network until all the interpretable models explain
  the desired proportion of data. Our extensive experiments show that our <em>route,
  interpret, and repeat</em> approach (1) identifies a richer diverse set of instance-specific
  concepts with high concept completeness via interpretable models by specializing
  in various subsets of data without compromising in performance, (2) identifies the
  relatively “harder” samples to explain via residuals, (3) outperforms the interpretable
  by-design models by significant margins during test-time interventions, (4) can
  be used to fix the shortcut learned by the original Blackbox.
