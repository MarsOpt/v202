title: Improving Bi-level Optimization Based Methods with Inspiration from Humans’
  Classroom Study Techniques
openreview: e5qDTqs1MS
abstract: In humans’ classroom learning, many effective study techniques (e.g., the
  Feynman technique, peer questioning, etc.) have been developed to improve learning
  outcomes. We are interested in investigating whether these techniques can inspire
  the development of ML training strategies to improve bi-level optimization (BLO)
  based methods. Towards this goal, we develop a general framework, Skillearn, which
  consists of basic elements such as learners, interaction functions, learning stages,
  etc. These elements can be flexibly configured to create various training strategies,
  each emulating a study technique of humans. In case studies, we apply Skillearn
  to create new training strategies, by emulating the Feynman technique and peer questioning,
  which are two broadly adopted techniques in humans’ classroom learning. These training
  strategies are used for improving two BLO based applications including neural architecture
  search and data weighting. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our methods.
