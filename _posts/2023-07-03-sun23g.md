title: 'MABe22: A Multi-Species Multi-Task Benchmark for Learned Representations of
  Behavior'
openreview: Asrg2we3dP
abstract: We introduce MABe22, a large-scale, multi-agent video and trajectory benchmark
  to assess the quality of learned behavior representations. This dataset is collected
  from a variety of biology experiments, and includes triplets of interacting mice
  (4.7 million frames video+pose tracking data, 10 million frames pose only), symbiotic
  beetle-ant interactions (10 million frames video data), and groups of interacting
  flies (4.4 million frames of pose tracking data). Accompanying these data, we introduce
  a panel of real-life downstream analysis tasks to assess the quality of learned
  representations by evaluating how well they preserve information about the experimental
  conditions (e.g. strain, time of day, optogenetic stimulation) and animal behavior.
  We test multiple state-of-the-art self-supervised video and trajectory representation
  learning methods to demonstrate the use of our benchmark, revealing that methods
  developed using human action datasets do not fully translate to animal datasets.
  We hope that our benchmark and dataset encourage a broader exploration of behavior
  representation learning methods across species and settings.
