title: Group Equivariant Fourier Neural Operators for Partial Differential Equations
openreview: kgAOY5x4fi
abstract: We consider solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with Fourier neural
  operators (FNOs), which operate in the frequency domain. Since the laws of physics
  do not depend on the coordinate system used to describe them, it is desirable to
  encode such symmetries in the neural operator architecture for better performance
  and easier learning. While encoding symmetries in the physical domain using group
  theory has been studied extensively, how to capture symmetries in the frequency
  domain is under-explored. In this work, we extend group convolutions to the frequency
  domain and design Fourier layers that are equivariant to rotations, translations,
  and reflections by leveraging the equivariance property of the Fourier transform.
  The resulting $G$-FNO architecture generalizes well across input resolutions and
  performs well in settings with varying levels of symmetry. Our code is publicly
  available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).
