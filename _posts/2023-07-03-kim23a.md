title: 'CrossSplit: Mitigating Label Noise Memorization through Data Splitting'
openreview: yeF3FMIIpm
abstract: 'We approach the problem of improving robustness of deep learning algorithms
  in the presence of label noise. Building upon existing label correction and co-teaching
  methods, we propose a novel training procedure to mitigate the memorization of noisy
  labels, called CrossSplit, which uses a pair of neural networks trained on two disjoint
  parts of the labeled dataset. CrossSplit combines two main ingredients: (i) Cross-split
  label correction. The idea is that, since the model trained on one part of the data
  cannot memorize example-label pairs from the other part, the training labels presented
  to each network can be smoothly adjusted by using the predictions of its peer network;
  (ii) Cross-split semi-supervised training. A network trained on one part of the
  data also uses the unlabeled inputs of the other part. Extensive experiments on
  CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and mini-WebVision datasets demonstrate that
  our method can outperform the current state-of-the-art in a wide range of noise
  ratios. The project page is at https://rlawlgul.github.io/.'
