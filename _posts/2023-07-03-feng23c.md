title: Fractional Denoising for 3D Molecular Pre-training
openreview: vH6cWEqceA
abstract: Coordinate denoising is a promising 3D molecular pre-training method, which
  has achieved remarkable performance in various downstream drug discovery tasks.
  Theoretically, the objective is equivalent to learning the force field, which is
  revealed helpful for downstream tasks. Nevertheless, there are two challenges for
  coordinate denoising to learn an effective force field, i.e. low coverage samples
  and isotropic force field. The underlying reason is that molecular distributions
  assumed by existing denoising methods fail to capture the anisotropic characteristic
  of molecules. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid noise strategy,
  including noises on both dihedral angel and coordinate. However, denoising such
  hybrid noise in a traditional way is no more equivalent to learning the force field.
  Through theoretical deductions, we find that the problem is caused by the dependency
  of the input conformation for covariance. To this end, we propose to decouple the
  two types of noise and design a novel fractional denoising method (Frad), which
  only denoises the latter coordinate part. In this way, Frad enjoys both the merits
  of sampling more low-energy structures and the force field equivalence. Extensive
  experiments show the effectiveness of Frad in molecule representation, with a new
  state-of-the-art on 9 out of 12 tasks of QM9 and on 7 out of 8 targets of MD17.
