title: 'NP-SemiSeg: When Neural Processes meet Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation'
openreview: Ir3Hty3Aj2
abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation involves assigning pixel-wise labels
  to unlabeled images at training time. This is useful in a wide range of real-world
  applications where collecting pixel-wise labels is not feasible in time or cost.
  Current approaches to semi-supervised semantic segmentation work by predicting pseudo-labels
  for each pixel from a class-wise probability distribution output by a model. If
  this predicted probability distribution is incorrect, however, it leads to poor
  segmentation results which can have knock-on consequences in safety critical systems,
  like medical images or self-driving cars. It is, therefore, important to understand
  what a model does not know, which is mainly achieved by uncertainty quantification.
  Recently, neural processes (NPs) have been explored in semi-supervised image classification,
  and they have been a computationally efficient and effective method for uncertainty
  quantification. In this work, we move one step forward by adapting NPs to semi-supervised
  semantic segmentation, resulting in a new model called NP-SemiSeg. We experimentally
  evaluated NP-SemiSeg on the public benchmarks PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, with
  different training settings, and the results verify its effectiveness.
