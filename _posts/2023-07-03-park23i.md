title: Predictable MDP Abstraction for Unsupervised Model-Based RL
openreview: pj3EXUk5Uj
abstract: 'A key component of model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a dynamics
  model that predicts the outcomes of actions. Errors in this predictive model can
  degrade the performance of model-based controllers, and complex Markov decision
  processes (MDPs) can present exceptionally difficult prediction problems. To mitigate
  this issue, we propose predictable MDP abstraction (PMA): instead of training a
  predictive model on the original MDP, we train a model on a transformed MDP with
  a learned action space that only permits predictable, easy-to-model actions, while
  covering the original state-action space as much as possible. As a result, model
  learning becomes easier and more accurate, which allows robust, stable model-based
  planning or model-based RL. This transformation is learned in an unsupervised manner,
  before any task is specified by the user. Downstream tasks can then be solved with
  model-based control in a zero-shot fashion, without additional environment interactions.
  We theoretically analyze PMA and empirically demonstrate that PMA leads to significant
  improvements over prior unsupervised model-based RL approaches in a range of benchmark
  environments. Our code and videos are available at https://seohong.me/projects/pma/'
