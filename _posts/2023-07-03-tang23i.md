title: Defects of Convolutional Decoder Networks in Frequency Representation
openreview: dxUciRMAaE
abstract: In this paper, we prove the representation defects of a cascaded convolutional
  decoder network, considering the capacity of representing different frequency components
  of an input sample. We conduct the discrete Fourier transform on each channel of
  the feature map in an intermediate layer of the decoder network. Then, we extend
  the 2D circular convolution theorem to represent the forward and backward propagations
  through convolutional layers in the frequency domain. Based on this, we prove three
  defects in representing feature spectrums. First, we prove that the convolution
  operation, the zero-padding operation, and a set of other settings all make a convolutional
  decoder network more likely to weaken high-frequency components. Second, we prove
  that the upsampling operation generates a feature spectrum, in which strong signals
  repetitively appear at certain frequencies. Third, we prove that if the frequency
  components in the input sample and frequency components in the target output for
  regression have a small shift, then the decoder usually cannot be effectively learned.
