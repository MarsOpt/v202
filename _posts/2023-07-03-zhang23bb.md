title: Towards a Persistence Diagram that is Robust to Noise and Varied Densities
openreview: r2aulTsJ8V
abstract: Recent works have identified that existing methods, which construct persistence
  diagrams in Topological Data Analysis (TDA), are not robust to noise and varied
  densities in a point cloud. We analyze the necessary properties of an approach that
  can address these two issues, and propose a new filter function for TDA based on
  a new data-dependent kernel which possesses these properties. Our empirical evaluation
  reveals that the proposed filter function provides a better means for t-SNE visualization
  and SVM classification than three existing methods of TDA.
