title: Trajectory-Aware Eligibility Traces for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning
openreview: 8Lww9LXokZ
abstract: 'Off-policy learning from multistep returns is crucial for sample-efficient
  reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating variance
  is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner:
  past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance
  Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms
  rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios
  (traces) to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace
  has been cut, the effect cannot be easily reversed. This has led to the development
  of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a
  time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their
  theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep
  operator that unifies per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence
  conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees
  for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded
  Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly
  across $\lambda$-values in an off-policy control task.'
