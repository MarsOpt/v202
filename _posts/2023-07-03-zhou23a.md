title: 'Multi-agent Online Scheduling: MMS Allocations for Indivisible Items'
openreview: vu1c5FUSF0
abstract: We consider the problem of fairly allocating a sequence of indivisible items
  that arrive online in an arbitrary order to a group of $n$ agents with additive
  normalized valuation functions, we consider the allocation of goods and chores separately
  and propose algorithms for approximating maximin share (MMS) allocations for both
  settings. When agents have identical valuation functions the problem coincides with
  the semi-online machine covering problem (when items are goods) and load balancing
  problem (when items are chores), for both of which optimal competitive ratios have
  been achieved. In this paper we consider the case when agents have general additive
  valuation functions. For the allocation of goods we show that no competitive algorithm
  exists even when there are only three agents and propose an optimal $0.5$-competitive
  algorithm for the case of two agents. For the allocation of chores we propose a
  $(2-1/n)$-competitive algorithm for $n\geq 3$ agents and a $\sqrt{2}\approx 1.414$-competitive
  algorithm for two agents. Additionally, we show that no algorithm can do better
  than $15/11\approx 1.364$-competitive for two agents.
