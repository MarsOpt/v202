title: On Uni-Modal Feature Learning in Supervised Multi-Modal Learning
openreview: HNbwCYFOZM
abstract: We abstract the features (i.e. learned representations) of multi-modal data
  into 1) uni-modal features, which can be learned from uni-modal training, and 2)
  paired features, which can only be learned from cross-modal interactions. Multi-modal
  models are expected to benefit from cross-modal interactions on the basis of ensuring
  uni-modal feature learning. However, recent supervised multi-modal late-fusion training
  approaches still suffer from insufficient learning of uni-modal features on each
  modality. We prove that this phenomenon does hurt the modelâ€™s generalization ability.
  To this end, we propose to choose a targeted late-fusion learning method for the
  given supervised multi-modal task from Uni-Modal Ensemble (UME) and the proposed
  Uni-Modal Teacher (UMT), according to the distribution of uni-modal and paired features.
  We demonstrate that, under a simple guiding strategy, we can achieve comparable
  results to other complex late-fusion or intermediate-fusion methods on various multi-modal
  datasets, including VGG-Sound, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and ModelNet40.
