title: Horizon-Free and Variance-Dependent Reinforcement Learning for Latent Markov
  Decision Processes
openreview: t08AihqKPQ
abstract: We study regret minimization for reinforcement learning (RL) in Latent Markov
  Decision Processes (LMDPs) with context in hindsight. We design a novel model-based
  algorithmic framework which can be instantiated with both a model-optimistic and
  a value-optimistic solver. We prove an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathsf{Var}^\star M \Gamma
  S A K})$ regret bound where $\tilde{O}$ hides logarithm factors, $M$ is the number
  of contexts, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $K$ is the
  number of episodes, $\Gamma \le S$ is the maximum transition degree of any state-action
  pair, and $\mathsf{Var}^\star$ is a variance quantity describing the determinism
  of the LMDP. The regret bound only scales logarithmically with the planning horizon,
  thus yielding the first (nearly) horizon-free regret bound for LMDP. This is also
  the first problem-dependent regret bound for LMDP. Key in our proof is an analysis
  of the total variance of alpha vectors (a generalization of value functions), which
  is handled with a truncation method. We complement our positive result with a novel
  $\Omega(\sqrt{\mathsf{Var}^\star M S A K})$ regret lower bound with $\Gamma = 2$,
  which shows our upper bound minimax optimal when $\Gamma$ is a constant for the
  class of variance-bounded LMDPs. Our lower bound relies on new constructions of
  hard instances and an argument inspired by the symmetrization technique from theoretical
  computer science, both of which are technically different from existing lower bound
  proof for MDPs, and thus can be of independent interest.
