title: Linear CNNs Discover the Statistical Structure of the Dataset Using Only the
  Most Dominant Frequencies
openreview: ZFBf47ZNos
abstract: We here present a stepping stone towards a deeper understanding of convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs) in the form of a theory of learning in linear CNNs. Through
  analyzing the gradient descent equations, we discover that the evolution of the
  network during training is determined by the interplay between the dataset structure
  and the convolutional network structure. We show that linear CNNs discover the statistical
  structure of the dataset with non-linear, ordered, stage-like transitions, and that
  the speed of discovery changes depending on the relationship between the dataset
  and the convolutional network structure. Moreover, we find that this interplay lies
  at the heart of what we call the "dominant frequency bias", where linear CNNs arrive
  at these discoveries using only the dominant frequencies of the different structural
  parts present in the dataset. We furthermore provide experiments that show how our
  theory relates to deep, non-linear CNNs used in practice. Our findings shed new
  light on the inner working of CNNs, and can help explain their shortcut learning
  and their tendency to rely on texture instead of shape.
