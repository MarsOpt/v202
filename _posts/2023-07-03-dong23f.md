title: Adaptively Weighted Data Augmentation Consistency Regularization for Robust
  Optimization under Concept Shift
openreview: 5KX2NKgFjD
abstract: Concept shift is a prevailing problem in natural tasks like medical image
  segmentation where samples usually come from different subpopulations with variant
  correlations between features and labels. One common type of concept shift in medical
  image segmentation is the "information imbalance" between label-sparse samples with
  few (if any) segmentation labels and label-dense samples with plentiful labeled
  pixels. Existing distributionally robust algorithms have focused on adaptively truncating/down-weighting
  the "less informative" (i.e., label-sparse in our context) samples. To exploit data
  features of label-sparse samples more efficiently, we propose an adaptively weighted
  online optimization algorithm — AdaWAC — to incorporate data augmentation consistency
  regularization in sample reweighting. Our method introduces a set of trainable weights
  to balance the supervised loss and unsupervised consistency regularization of each
  sample separately. At the saddle point of the underlying objective, the weights
  assign label-dense samples to the supervised loss and label-sparse samples to the
  unsupervised consistency regularization. We provide a convergence guarantee by recasting
  the optimization as online mirror descent on a saddle point problem. Our empirical
  results demonstrate that AdaWAC not only enhances the segmentation performance and
  sample efficiency but also improves the robustness to concept shift on various medical
  image segmentation tasks with different UNet-style backbones.
