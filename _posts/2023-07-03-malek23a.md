title: Additive Causal Bandits with Unknown Graph
openreview: 2NCTb7tSIp
abstract: We explore algorithms to select actions in the causal bandit setting where
  the learner can choose to intervene on a set of random variables related by a causal
  graph, and the learner sequentially chooses interventions and observes a sample
  from the interventional distribution. The learnerâ€™s goal is to quickly find the
  intervention, among all interventions on observable variables, that maximizes the
  expectation of an outcome variable. We depart from previous literature by assuming
  no knowledge of the causal graph except that latent confounders between the outcome
  and its ancestors are not present. We first show that the unknown graph problem
  can be exponentially hard in the parents of the outcome. To remedy this, we adopt
  an additional additive assumption on the outcome which allows us to solve the problem
  by casting it as an additive combinatorial linear bandit problem with full-bandit
  feedback. We propose a novel action-elimination algorithm for this setting, show
  how to apply this algorithm to the causal bandit problem, provide sample complexity
  bounds, and empirically validate our findings on a suite of randomly generated causal
  models, effectively showing that one does not need to explicitly learn the parents
  of the outcome to identify the best intervention.
