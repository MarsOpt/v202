title: Concept-based Explanations for Out-of-Distribution Detectors
openreview: a33IYBCFey
abstract: 'Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
  safe deployment of deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. While a myriad of methods
  have focused on improving the performance of OOD detectors, a critical gap remains
  in interpreting their decisions. We help bridge this gap by providing explanations
  for OOD detectors based on learned high-level concepts. We first propose two new
  metrics for assessing the effectiveness of a particular set of concepts for explaining
  OOD detectors: 1) detection completeness, which quantifies the sufficiency of concepts
  for explaining an OOD-detectorâ€™s decisions, and 2) concept separability, which captures
  the distributional separation between in-distribution and OOD data in the concept
  space. Based on these metrics, we propose an unsupervised framework for learning
  a set of concepts that satisfy the desired properties of high detection completeness
  and concept separability, and demonstrate its effectiveness in providing concept-based
  explanations for diverse off-the-shelf OOD detectors. We also show how to identify
  prominent concepts contributing to the detection results, and provide further reasoning
  about their decisions.'
