title: 'RACE: Improve Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Representation Asymmetry
  and Collaborative Evolution'
openreview: nHCfIQu2tV
abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has demonstrated its effectiveness
  in learning collaboration, but it often struggles with low-quality reward signals
  and high non-stationarity. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) has shown better
  convergence, robustness, and signal quality insensitivity. This paper introduces
  a hybrid framework, Representation Asymmetry and Collaboration Evolution (RACE),
  which combines EA and MARL for efficient collaboration. RACE maintains a MARL team
  and a population of EA teams. To enable efficient knowledge sharing and policy exploration,
  RACE decomposes the policies of different teams controlling the same agent into
  a shared nonlinear observation representation encoder and individual linear policy
  representations. To address the partial observation issue, we introduce Value-Aware
  Mutual Information Maximization to enhance the shared representation with useful
  information about superior global states. EA evolves the population using novel
  agent-level crossover and mutation operators, offering diverse experiences for MARL.
  Concurrently, MARL optimizes its policies and injects them into the population for
  evolution. The experiments on challenging continuous and discrete tasks demonstrate
  that RACE significantly improves the basic algorithms, consistently outperforming
  other algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/yeshenpy/RACE.
