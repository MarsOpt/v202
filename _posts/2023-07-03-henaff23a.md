title: A Study of Global and Episodic Bonuses for Exploration in Contextual MDPs
openreview: 1CqtvwHTKQ
abstract: Exploration in environments which differ across episodes has received increasing
  attention in recent years. Current methods use some combination of global novelty
  bonuses, computed using the agent’s entire training experience, and episodic novelty
  bonuses, computed using only experience from the current episode. However, the use
  of these two types of bonuses has been ad-hoc and poorly understood. In this work,
  we shed light on the behavior of these two types of bonuses through controlled experiments
  on easily interpretable tasks as well as challenging pixel-based settings. We find
  that the two types of bonuses succeed in different settings, with episodic bonuses
  being most effective when there is little shared structure across episodes and global
  bonuses being effective when more structure is shared. We develop a conceptual framework
  which makes this notion of shared structure precise by considering the variance
  of the value function across contexts, and which provides a unifying explanation
  of our empirical results. We furthermore find that combining the two bonuses can
  lead to more robust performance across different degrees of shared structure, and
  investigate different algorithmic choices for defining and combining global and
  episodic bonuses based on function approximation. This results in an algorithm which
  sets a new state of the art across 16 tasks from the MiniHack suite used in prior
  work, and also performs robustly on Habitat and Montezuma’s Revenge.
