title: A Unified Audio-Visual Learning Framework for Localization, Separation, and
  Recognition
openreview: SkC2ZATroO
abstract: The ability to accurately recognize, localize and separate sound sources
  is fundamental to any audio-visual perception task. Historically, these abilities
  were tackled separately, with several methods developed independently for each task.
  However, given the interconnected nature of source localization, separation, and
  recognition, independent models are likely to yield suboptimal performance as they
  fail to capture the interdependence between these tasks. To address this problem,
  we propose a unified audio-visual learning framework (dubbed OneAVM) that integrates
  audio and visual cues for joint localization, separation, and recognition. OneAVM
  comprises a shared audio-visual encoder and task-specific decoders trained with
  three objectives. The first objective aligns audio and visual representations through
  a localized audio-visual correspondence loss. The second tackles visual source separation
  using a traditional mix-and-separate framework. Finally, the third objective reinforces
  visual feature separation and localization by mixing images in pixel space and aligning
  their representations with those of all corresponding sound sources. Extensive experiments
  on MUSIC, VGG-Instruments, VGG-Music, and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
  of OneAVM for all three tasks, audio-visual source localization, separation, and
  nearest neighbor recognition, and empirically demonstrate a strong positive transfer
  between them.
