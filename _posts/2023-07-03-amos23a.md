title: Meta Optimal Transport
openreview: vinsvrSJmd
abstract: We study the use of amortized optimization to predict optimal transport
  (OT) maps from the input measures, which we call Meta OT. This helps repeatedly
  solve similar OT problems between different measures by leveraging the knowledge
  and information present from past problems to rapidly predict and solve new problems.
  Otherwise, standard methods ignore the knowledge of the past solutions and suboptimally
  re-solve each problem from scratch. We instantiate Meta OT models in discrete and
  continuous settings between grayscale images, spherical data, classification labels,
  and color palettes and use them to improve the computational time of standard OT
  solvers. Our source code is available at http://github.com/facebookresearch/meta-ot
