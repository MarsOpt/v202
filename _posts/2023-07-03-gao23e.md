title: 'DDGR: Continual Learning with Deep Diffusion-based Generative Replay'
openreview: RlqgQXZx6r
abstract: Popular deep-learning models in the field of image classification suffer
  from catastrophic forgettingâ€”models will forget previously acquired skills when
  learning new ones. Generative replay (GR), which typically consists of a generator
  and a classifier, is an efficient way to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However,
  conventional GR methods only focus on a single instruction relationship (generator-to-classifier),
  where the generator synthesizes samples for previous tasks to instruct the training
  of the classifier, while ignoring the ways in which the classifier can benefit the
  generator. In addition, most generative replay methods typically reuse the generated
  samples to update the generator, which causes the samples regenerated by the generator
  deviating from the distribution of previous tasks. To overcome these two issues,
  we propose a novel approach, called deep diffusion-based generative replay (DDGR),
  which adopts a diffusion model as the generator and calculates an instruction-operator
  through the classifier to instruct the generation of samples. Extensive experiments
  in class incremental (CI) and class incremental with repetition (CIR) settings demonstrate
  the advantages of DDGR. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiaocangshengGR/DDGR.
