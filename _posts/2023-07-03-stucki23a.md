title: Topologically Faithful Image Segmentation via Induced Matching of Persistence
  Barcodes
openreview: vlaPdKdbGK
abstract: Segmentation models predominantly optimize pixel-overlap-based loss, an
  objective that is actually inadequate for many segmentation tasks. In recent years,
  their limitations fueled a growing interest in topology-aware methods, which aim
  to recover the topology of the segmented structures. However, so far, existing methods
  only consider global topological properties, ignoring the need to preserve topological
  features spatially, which is crucial for accurate segmentation. We introduce the
  concept of induced matchings from persistent homology to achieve a spatially correct
  matching between persistence barcodes in a segmentation setting. Based on this concept,
  we define the Betti matching error as an interpretable, topologically and feature-wise
  accurate metric for image segmentations, which resolves the limitations of the Betti
  number error. Our Betti matching error is differentiable and efficient to use as
  a loss function. We demonstrate that it improves the topological performance of
  segmentation networks significantly across six diverse datasets while preserving
  the performance with respect to traditional scores. Our code is publicly available
  (https://github.com/nstucki/Betti-matching/).
