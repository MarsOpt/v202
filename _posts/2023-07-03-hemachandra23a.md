title: Training-Free Neural Active Learning with Initialization-Robustness Guarantees
openreview: t5MZWqRtLq
abstract: Existing neural active learning algorithms have aimed to optimize the predictive
  performance of neural networks (NNs) by selecting data for labelling. However, other
  than a good predictive performance, being robust against random parameter initializations
  is also a crucial requirement in safety-critical applications. To this end, we introduce
  our expected variance with Gaussian processes (EV-GP) criterion for neural active
  learning, which is theoretically guaranteed to select data points which lead to
  trained NNs with both (a) good predictive performances and (b) initialization robustness.
  Importantly, our EV-GP criterion is training-free, i.e., it does not require any
  training of the NN during data selection, which makes it computationally efficient.
  We empirically demonstrate that our EV-GP criterion is highly correlated with both
  initialization robustness and generalization performance, and show that it consistently
  outperforms baseline methods in terms of both desiderata, especially in situations
  with limited initial data or large batch sizes.
